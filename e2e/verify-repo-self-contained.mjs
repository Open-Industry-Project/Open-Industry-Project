// Does the repo contain what its tracked files reference? (static: no browser, no server)
//
// The working tree is not the repo: a file can be present on disk, referenced, and still absent
// from a clone because it is gitignored or was never `git add`ed. No other check sees that: tsc,
// eslint and vitest all read the working tree, so they pass on a tree that no clone can reproduce.
// This checks two kinds of reference, and both have been broken in this repo:
//
//   1. citations - a comment naming the probe that measured a constant.
//   2. imports   - a tracked module importing a source file that was never committed.
//
// (1) in detail:
//
// ~100 comments across src/, e2e/, scripts/ and examples/ justify a constant by naming the probe
// that measured it: "ARM_REACH_X is measured (e2e/probes/arm-envelope.mjs)", the draw-budget
// instruments AGENTS.md tells readers to run, the rack clearances verify-agv-rack-putaway.mjs
// depends on. Probes worth keeping live in e2e/probes/ and are tracked; `e2e/_dbg-*` is the
// gitignored scratch name for one-off probes that are deleted after use.
// A citation is broken if it names a scratch `_dbg-` file, which no clone has, or an e2e/probes/
// file that was never `git add`ed. Both have happened: three probes cited by src/core were never
// committed, so the numbers based on them can no longer be reproduced.
//
// A reader cannot verify a citation they cannot run. This gate makes that a build error: a probe
// cited from tracked code must be a tracked file under e2e/probes/.
//
// The check is transitive: an instrument may cite another for its own attribution, and that one
// has to be in the clone too.
//
// (2) in detail:
//
// A tracked module that imports an untracked file builds here and fails in a clone. At one point
// 16 such modules (src/plc/ladder.ts, src/core/opcUa.ts, src/collab/codeTrust.ts,
// src/editor/keyHint.ts, scripts/lib/conveyorComms.mjs and more) were reachable from 41 tracked
// importers while every other check passed, because in a long-lived dirty tree "on disk" and
// "in the repo" diverge without any warning. tsc cannot catch it: it resolves against the
// filesystem and ignores .gitignore.
//
// Only resolved-but-untracked is a failure. An import that resolves nowhere is tsc's job, and
// failing it here would mean reimplementing vite's resolver (aliases, `?raw`, conditional
// exports) reliably, which is not worth it for a gate.
//
// The failure judges the index, which is what the next commit holds: a staged importer whose
// target is not staged. An unstaged edit that imports a new, unstaged file is work in progress, so
// it is listed as a reminder and does not fail. Judging the working tree failed every local run
// during any change that adds a file. CI's tree is clean, so there the two are the same.
//
// Run: node e2e/verify-repo-self-contained.mjs
//      node e2e/verify-repo-self-contained.mjs --list    print the closure, one cited probe per line
