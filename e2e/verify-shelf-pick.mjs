// Can a truck take a load back off a shelf? This is the shipping-loop step no other gate checks.
//
// Putting a load away is covered (verify-agv-rack-putaway). Taking one back is not the same move in reverse:
// the load is already there, so the blade has to fit a pocket 1.62 m up rather than merely clear the beams,
// and then lift a load that has been sleeping (physics-wise) on the slab. Whether it comes out cleanly is a
// physics question, not an arithmetic one, and this script answers it.
//
// It drives the truck through the cell's own program rather than around it. Setting the device tags directly
// does not work: world.setBehaviorInputTags replaces the device-IO table wholesale, and the controller pushes
// the program's whole tag set every scan, so a tag injected from a test survives about one scan before it is
// wiped (the truck stayed at its charge bay through five commands).
//
// So this swaps the rack truck's pick rows (1..5, the five the PalletTruck block drives as "the pick") for a
// pick off a rack shelf, stands a load on the staging lane's eye so the program dispatches it, and lets the
// shipped sequence do the work, which makes it a rehearsal of the real retrieval move rather than a
// stand-in.
//
// This script stages the load. The demo has one rack truck, and the whole bottom shelf of the rack it works
// is its put-away bays, so the demo stocks nothing there (demoScenes.ts, "none on the NEAR rack's bottom
// shelf"). The racked stock it does carry is on other racks, or on levels this truck's mast cannot reach. So
// a copy of the demo's own racked stock (an oip.unit-load, exactly what a stocked shelf holds) is set into the
// truck's first put-away bay before Play, which is a bay its own route reaches into.
//
// Every height and position is read off the truck's own route: its first put-away (4 rows: lineup at the
// over-the-beams height, in, down onto the slab, back out through the pockets) says where it lines up, where it
// stands to reach the bay, how high the load clears the lip (OVER) and how high a blade threads the pocket of a
// load standing on that slab (the withdraw height, THREAD).
