// Gate: under WebGPU the staged pre-warm must compile the scene's pipelines behind the cover, not
// merely finish before it lifts.
//
// Its sibling verify-webgpu-cover-holds asserts ordering (cover-lift >= warm-done) and cannot see
// the failure this one catches: shrink what the pre-warm covers and both signals move together, so
// the cover lifts sooner, the gate stays green, and the compiles happen on the user's first frames
// instead. Measured with ?phase1overlap: dropping phase 1's await moves the cover 3613 -> 3067 ms
// and at the same time shrinks the pre-warm from 485 items / 80 pipelines to 101 / 45, because
// phase 1's 1.3 s wait is also the window in which the parts' async GLB attachments arrive.
// 35 pipelines then compile on-draw after the reveal, and cover-holds passes on both arms.
//
// The invariant is a floor on what the pre-warm covered at the moment the cover lifted: how many
// compilation items it walked, and how many pipelines were warm. Budget-style, like
// verify-draw-budget: a scene change may legitimately move these, and then you raise them
// deliberately in the same commit.
//
// An approach that does not work, noted so nobody rebuilds it: "pipelines created after the reveal
// must be explained by the extras' own count." That conflates deliberately-deferred work with missed
// work and fails on a healthy tree (35 after-reveal pipelines vs 6 rows), because warmInteractionExtras
// also creates pipelines through the live draw path (warmSelectionOutline renders a real off-screen mask
// pass), which never appears in the compileAsync rows. The remainder is still printed, as diagnosis only.
//
// Reads globalThis.__oipCompilePhases / __oipPipelineTimes (viewCompileLedger.ts, diagnostics-only marks).
// Runs headless (Edge -> real WebGPU). Run: node e2e/verify-webgpu-warm-completeness.mjs
