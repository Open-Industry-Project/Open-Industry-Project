// Build one part from its part.js, in memory: the two files the app loads. build-parts writes them, check-part checks
// what would be written.
//
// A part.js's definePart() holds the whole part: `manifest` (the manifest minus its geometry, or with a static
// `manifest.geometry`), `rig(params)` (links, joints and bounds computed from the params), the params, geometry() and
// step(). It may import other modules by relative path. From it:
//   the behavior   part.js with its imports joined in and `manifest` / `rig()` left out (bundlePart.mjs)
//   the manifest   `manifest`, its rig compiled from rig() (src/core/rigCompile.ts)
//
// The file names depend on where the part lives. A part folder anywhere (a project's parts/<slug>/, a library's source
// folder) gets manifest.json + behavior.js, the names the app reads (docs/projects.md), and its banners and problems
// name files relative to the part folder. This repo's examples/parts/<dir>/ keep rig.json + behavior.ts and name files
// from the repo root, with no newline after the manifest, so the built-ins' committed bytes stay as they are.
