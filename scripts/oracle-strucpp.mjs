// Second external oracle: replays the ST conformance corpus through STruC++, an IEC
// 61131-3 *3rd edition* compiler, alongside the MATIEC (2nd edition) gate.
//
// Why a second one: MATIEC is strict and old. It refuses every implicit conversion, but also
// things the standard has allowed since 2013, so one compiler cannot tell "our defect" from
// "the oracle's edition". Two compilers of different editions make that a measurement:
//
//   both reject                    -> our defect
//   MATIEC rejects, STruC++ takes  -> an edition difference, and the corpus says so
//   MATIEC takes, STruC++ rejects  -> worth a look; usually a gap in the younger compiler
//
// One measured asymmetry: MATIEC is the strictness oracle and STruC++ is not. At v0.6.2
// STruC++ accepts a missing statement separator and an assignment to a FOR control variable,
// both forbidden by IEC, so a program we reject that it accepts is reported, not failed.
//
// What this gate is for: STruC++'s coverage is narrower than MATIEC's in places (STRUCPP_GAPS
// below), so as a broad gate it would mostly report its own gaps. Its job is small: every
// case annotated `oracle.editionReject` must compile under it, so "IEC 3rd edition allows this"
// is checked on every push. It is also the compiler OpenPLC's editor ships.
// GPL-3.0: this invokes it as a build tool and never links or vendors it.
//
// THE RUN TIER (--execute). Every case that compiles is also BUILT with g++ against the release's
// runtime headers and stepped scan by scan, the image diffed against the goldens as MATIEC's tier 2
// does (oracle-matiec.mjs `diffCase`). The driver is src/plc/oracleStrucpp.ts, unit-tested; its
// scheduling is its own, so this tier checks the code STruC++ generates, not a runtime.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/oracle-strucpp.mjs                 # compile the corpus, check the claims
//   node scripts/oracle-strucpp.mjs --execute       # ... and build, run and diff what compiles (needs g++)
//   STRUCPP=/path/to/strucpp node scripts/oracle-strucpp.mjs
//   STRUCPP_RUNTIME=/path/to/runtime/include      # if the headers are not at <strucpp dir>/runtime/include
//   (every run writes the names the release's bundled libraries put in a build to .oracle-ed3/library-names.txt)
