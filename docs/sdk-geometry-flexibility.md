# SDK geometry flexibility: render flags + the geometry context

Two general SDK capabilities let a part author geometry the engine would otherwise have to hard-code for
it: render-only flags on `MeshPart`, and a `GeometryContext` that hands `geometry()` the placement-dependent
seam it cannot compute from params. The Roller Conveyor's skew (transfer plate, clipped rollers) uses both, and it
is authored entirely in the part. Related reading:
[procedural-geometry.md](procedural-geometry.md) (the authoring ladder),
[architecture.md](architecture.md) (built-ins are custom parts),
[seam-resolvers.md](seam-resolvers.md) (world phase).

## The rule

> The engine may contain only **general, composable capabilities that any part can use**, never code
> keyed to one specific part.

A part that can only be built because the engine hard-codes *its* geometry is not a reference an SDK
author can follow. So nothing named `roller` or `skew` lives in the engine. Roller parts draw their whole bed
as instanced banks with `spin` (`examples/parts/_shared/rollerBed.js`). The rig keeps only general features:
`worldPhase`, `inclineParam` and the `leg` trestle.

## Why the roller bed stays on the rig tier

Converting a straight roller bed to a `kind: 'drawn'` part (like the Spur Roller) would lose two things:

- **World phase.** Butted straight beds must drop rollers on one shared *world* pitch grid
  ([seam-resolvers.md](seam-resolvers.md#the-roller-grid)). That depends on the part's world position, which
  `geometry(g, params)` never sees (`core/geometryEval.ts`). The rig array-link path resolves it. The Spur can be
  `drawn` because a spur never butts into a continuous run.
- **Incline and legs.** `inclineParam` (whole-bed tilt of render **and** collision, `conveyor-incline.md`)
  and the `leg` trestle are host-resolved rig features with no equivalent for a `drawn` part.

So the bed is a rig part with a composed `geometry()`, and that `geometry()` needs the two capabilities below.

## Render-only mesh properties on `MeshPart`

```ts
interface MeshPart {
  // …
  castShadow?: boolean    // default true; false = a render-only decal/dead-plate that casts nothing
  doubleSided?: boolean   // default false; render both faces (thin sheets, backs of open panels)
}
```

Both are honoured in `buildFunctionMesh` and the rig `realizeProceduralGeometry` path. `castShadow` threads into
`shadowMesh(geo, mat, castShadow)`. `doubleSided` gives the submesh its own `DoubleSide` material instance, because
shared role materials must not be flipped for every part. `colorParam` follows the same own-instance rule. Decals,
dead-plates, thin sheets and the backs of wire panels use these flags. The skew transfer plate is about 15 lines of
author `surface()` code with both set.

## `GeometryContext`: the placement seam `geometry()` needs

Butted roller beds read as one bed because both sit on the shared world pitch grid. The pair straddling a
seam is always exactly one pitch apart, so the clear gap there is `pitch − 2R` (27 mm) **whatever the phase**.
A skewed bed ends in the *plate*, not a roller. With the plate stopping flush at the frame, the neighbour's
first roller is still wherever the grid put it. So the bare deck after the plate equals the phase, up to
`pitch − R` (51 mm). That is nearly twice a normal gap, right at the transfer point, and it looks fine at some
positions and wrong at others.

Neither the params nor a fixed constant can fix it:

- **Params can't.** The phase depends on where the bed sits in world X, which `geometry(g, params)`
  cannot see.
- **A fixed lap can't either.** Lapping the plate a constant `R` bounds the gap correctly. But at the phases
  where the neighbour's first roller straddles the seam, the lip then sits *on top of* that roller (the plate
  top sits 1 mm above the roller crown), which looks worse than the gap.

So `geometry()` takes a third argument, `ctx: GeometryContext` (`core/partApi.ts`), carrying the host-resolved
seam:

```ts
export interface GeometryContext {
  deltas?: ReadonlyArray<readonly [number, number, number]> // the world-phase grid, part-local
  pitch?: number                                            // its spacing
  butt?: { head: boolean; tail: boolean }                   // does this end abut a collinear neighbour?
}
```

`deltas` and `pitch` give the phase. The next grid line past the head is `last + pitch`, and because collinear
beds share one grid, that is where the neighbour's first roller sits. `butt` comes straight off the resolved
`RollerGrid`. The resolver already computes it to suppress that end's edge nudge. It answers the one question the
grid alone can't: whether there is anything out there to meet. The plate laps to the neighbour roller's face,
bounded by `R`, and only at a butt. A free end stays flush.

Every field is optional and the object may be empty. A part that ignores `ctx` is unaffected, and every
placement-free caller (parity tests, headless probes) gets the placement-free geometry. Determinism is over
`(params, ctx)`.

**Plumbing.** The rig resolves the bed grid once per refresh, so the plate and the rollers it fills between
are drawn against the same grid. The seam is part of `realizeProceduralGeometry`'s re-emit key. A part's first
refresh runs before the scene resolve hands the rig its grid, so `butt` is the only thing that changes on the
pass that learns the bed has a neighbour. Leave it out of the key and that pass early-outs on an unchanged key,
and the seam geometry never appears.

Gated by [e2e/verify-skew-transfer-seam.mjs](../e2e/verify-skew-transfer-seam.mjs), which sweeps a butted pair
through a whole pitch on the rendered bed, plus the `transfer lip across a butt seam` unit block in
`rollerConveyorRigParity.test.ts` for the part's own arithmetic.
[verify-roller-skew.mjs](../e2e/verify-roller-skew.mjs) finds the part-authored plate by its material (the one
double-sided, shadow-off mesh in the part's group).
