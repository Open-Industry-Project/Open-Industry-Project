# Part author's guide

This guide covers building a custom part for OIP, from a blank box to a PLC-connected machine you can hand
to someone as a single file. Every built-in part is authored on this same SDK
([architecture.md](architecture.md)), so [`examples/parts/`](../examples/parts/) is a library of worked
examples: whatever you are building, a shipped part already does something like it.

The API reference is the generated SDK in [`packages/part-sdk/`](../packages/part-sdk/), the same types the
in-app editor uses for autocomplete. This guide is the overview; those files have the details:

- [`index.d.ts`](../packages/part-sdk/index.d.ts): the behavior (`definePart`, params, `ctx`).
- [`manifest.d.ts`](../packages/part-sdk/manifest.d.ts): the manifest (`PackageManifest`): geometry, rig
  links and joints, every shape kind and link capability (`beam`, `zone`, `conveys`, `array`, …), assets and
  materials. Each shape kind is its own documented interface (`RigMeshShape`, `RigBoxShape`, …).
- [`manifest.schema.json`](../packages/part-sdk/manifest.schema.json): the manifest as JSON Schema. Put
  `"$schema": "<path>/manifest.schema.json"` at the top of a `manifest.json` and VS Code completes and checks it.

A part on disk is a folder with `manifest.json` and `behavior.js`. Name yours that way. The loader also
reads `rig.json` and `behavior.ts`, the older names the built-ins in `examples/parts/` use (the `.ts` holds
plain JS); read a linked `rig.json` / `behavior.ts` as the `manifest.json` / `behavior.js` you would write.
In a folder that also has a `part.js`, those two files are built from it
([Writing a part as one `part.js`](#writing-a-part-as-one-partjs)), so read the `part.js`. The other examples are
hand-written and edited in place.

The SDK is pre-1.0 and can break between releases. See
[Stability](../packages/part-sdk/README.md#stability) in the SDK README.

## What a part is

A part is one portable, deterministic package:

- **Geometry**, in the manifest: a rig of links and joints, or shapes drawn by a `geometry(g, params)`
  function (`kind: 'drawn'`) for swept and lofted forms.
- **What it is to the host**, declared in the manifest:
  - `conveyor`: what kind of conveyor it is, what cargo rides on, which params are its speed and reverse flag.
  - `commsParam`: the boolean that switches its PLC link.
  - `snap`: how it connects to other parts.
  - `holds`: the cargo it stores, `{ part, positions, limitParam?, params? }`: a cargo package id and its
    gripper links bottom first. `params` hands the items some of the holder's own params
    (`{ size: 'palletSize' }`). The Inspector's Fill / Empty place real parts at those positions, parented to
    the part, and the behavior grips what it finds there when the run starts
    ([pallet-dispenser](../examples/parts/pallet-dispenser/)).

  A part that declares none of these is not a conveyor, is always connected, connects to nothing, and
  stores nothing.
- **Behavior**: one JS script calling `definePart({ params, step(ctx) { … } })`, run every fixed sim tick.
  No imports, no DOM, no network; everything comes in through `ctx`.
- **Params**: the schema you declare in `definePart` is baked into the package, so the Inspector renders your
  fields without running your code.

The same package loads in the browser, the desktop app and a shared scene. Behaviors must be deterministic. Use
`ctx.simTime`, `ctx.dt` and `ctx.rng()` (a seeded PRNG) where you would reach for `Date` or `Math.random`
([Ground rules](#ground-rules)).

## The authoring loops

### In the browser

In the Parts dock, click **＋ New part**. You get a box at the origin, open in the Part Editor. Select rig
nodes in the Inspector to reshape, add or move links (gizmo drags work and are undoable).

- **Shape → Kind** switches what a node is. The panel builds `box`, `cylinder`, `cone` and `frame` from
  nothing, and switching keeps the node's dimensions.
- **New node** picks the kind **＋ Add child node** drops in.
- A `mesh` link comes from **Import model…**, the only route that supplies the GLB.
- `leg` and `label` are authored in the manifest. The selector shows them but can't construct one.
- Select the part itself to set its **Name** and **Category**.

**Edit behavior** opens the in-app editor, with the full SDK types and live validation; Apply commits to the
running catalog. Browser-authored parts persist in your project. A structurally invalid rig edit is blocked
and never registered: the last working version stays live, and the diagnostics show as a toast, a ⚠ badge
on the catalog card, and a strip in the Inspector.

### On the desktop

A project keeps its parts in its folder as `parts/<part>/manifest.json` + `behavior.js`. Any part's *Open in
external editor* opens that `behavior.js` (a built-in first becomes this project's own copy; other projects
keep the built-in). Saves in your IDE come back into the app: placed instances rebuild, and a running sim
swaps the behavior live. Edits made in the app are written to the same files. *File > Import Parts from
Folder…* copies parts from another folder into the open project.

A project's copy of a built-in records the version it was copied from (`origin.app` in its `manifest.json`,
written by the app). When a later app ships a changed built-in, the catalog card says *Updated* and you
choose: the app's new version, or the project's.

### Writing a part as one `part.js`

A part folder can hold one more file, `part.js`, that the folder's `manifest.json` and `behavior.js` are built from.
Use it when the rig follows the params: you write the rig as code, and the build works out the manifest's param refs.
Most built-ins are written this way, so their `part.js` files are worked examples
([safety-gate](../examples/parts/safety-gate/part.js), [belt-conveyor](../examples/parts/belt-conveyor/part.js)).

One `definePart` holds the whole part:

- `manifest`: everything a `manifest.json` holds (`id`, `name`, `category`, `conveyor`, `snap`, `materials`, and so
  on), typed as `PartSourceManifest` in the SDK. Leave `geometry` out when `rig()` computes it. A part whose
  geometry is not a rig (`drawn`, `cargo`) puts it in `manifest.geometry` and has no `rig()`.
- `rig(p)`: the rig's links, joints and bounds, computed from the params with ordinary arithmetic:
  `size: [0.03, p.raiseHeight + 0.15, p.width]`. It returns a rig geometry without its `kind`
  ([Tier 1](#tier-1-rig-links-and-joints) describes the fields).
- the params, `geometry()`, `step()` and the rest, as in any behavior.

Only the build reads `manifest` and `rig()`. The app never runs a `part.js`, and the shipped `behavior.js` leaves both
out, along with any helper nothing else calls.

**What the build fits, and what you write.** A manifest holds numbers and param refs, not code. So the build runs
`rig()` at the defaults and again with each param moved. Where a number follows the params in a form a ref can hold
(`param × scale + add` on a box's `sizeParams` or a link's `offsetParams`, for example), the build writes that ref in
place of the number. The fields and forms it fits are listed under `build-parts` in [cli.md](cli.md). It refuses a
rig it cannot express and names the field, for example a link that appears or goes with a param. Move that shape into
`geometry()`, or write the ref in `rig()`'s output yourself, spelled as the manifest spells it. Round your own derived
constants to 8 decimals (`const r8 = (n) => +n.toFixed(8)`), or the float noise lands in the manifest. Round no
coarser: the build checks each fit to 1e-7, and a value rounded to 6 decimals reads as not following its param.

**Shared modules.** A `part.js` may import named exports from other files by relative path:
`import { legPieces } from '../_shared/legs.js'`. The build joins each imported module into `behavior.js`, so the
shipped part carries its own copy and stays complete. The joined subset is small: `import { a, b } from './x.js'`
(no `as`, no default import), and `export function` / `export const` (no `export {}` lists, no default export). A
top-level name must be unique across the joined files. In a project, keep shared modules in `parts/_shared/`. The app
reads and writes only a part folder's `manifest.json`, `behavior.js` and asset files, so it never changes or removes
a `part.js` or anything else under `parts/`.

**Building and checking it**, from an oip-web checkout:

- `npm run build-parts -- path/to/parts/my-part` writes `manifest.json` and `behavior.js` beside the `part.js`. A
  bare name (`belt-conveyor`) means a folder in this repo's `examples/parts/`, where the two files are named
  `rig.json` and `behavior.ts`.
- `npm run build-parts -- --check path/to/parts/my-part` writes nothing, and fails when either file differs from
  what the `part.js` builds.
- `npm run check-part -- path/to/parts/my-part` builds the part in memory and checks the build
  ([Does it load?](#1-does-it-load)). It also reports a `stale` problem when the files beside the `part.js` are not
  what it builds.

**What ships, and what to edit.** The `manifest.json` and `behavior.js` are what the app loads, and what a project's
copy, a `.oippart` file and a part library carry. The `part.js` stays in your folder. So edit the `part.js` and
build again: a change made to the output is undone by the next build. The app edits a part through its output only.
The Part Editor and the agent tools write `manifest.json` and `behavior.js` and leave `part.js` as it was (the MCP
tools take a manifest object and a behavior script, never a `part.js`). After such an edit, `check-part` and
`build-parts -- --check` name the files that no longer match. `build-parts` refuses to overwrite a file that is newer
than its sources: copy the change into the `part.js` and build again, or pass `--force` to discard it.

### Testing

Right-click a placed part → *Open Part Editor* to isolate it, then press Play. The sim runs just your part
(plus anything you drop on it). To test without the app, see [Verify it headless](#verify-it-headless).

### Sharing

Every custom-part card has a **⤓ download** button that saves the part as `<id>.oippart`; the Parts dock's
**⤒ Import part** loads one. The file is the part folder zipped (`manifest.json`, `behavior.js`, models in
`assets/`), so unzipping gives an editable folder and zipping a folder gives an importable file. It is
validated again on import. This is also how you move a part between the browser and desktop. Older
`.part.json` files still import.

### Deleting

A part you authored or imported has a **✕** on its card. Deletion is blocked while the scene still places
the part, while it is open in the Part Editor, and in a live room. Deleting an edited built-in reverts the card to
the app's version (your changes are discarded). On the desktop the project's parts are files in
`<project>/parts/<slug>/`, and ✕ works the same way: the folder sync then removes the part's files. Deleting a
part's folder by hand does not remove the part. The folder sync checks the project folder once a second, and while
`project.json` still lists the deleted folder the folder does not load: the sync holds and shows the error until
the folder reads as a project again ([projects.md](projects.md#the-folder-is-the-project-two-way-sync)).

## Verify it headless

These commands run from an oip-web checkout in seconds, with real exit codes.

### 1. Does it load?

`npm run check-part -- path/to/my-part`:

- checks the manifest against the schema, catching typos the app would ignore (`noColision` validates and
  does nothing);
- bakes the behavior as the app does (determinism, rig, params, snap refs; errors carry behavior line numbers);
- reports the footprint at default params, PLC signals, joints, colliders, conveying links, beams and zones.

A folder with a `part.js` is built in memory first, and the checks run on that build
([Writing a part as one `part.js`](#writing-a-part-as-one-partjs)).

For a rig the footprint is the `bounds` you declared, so the rig is also measured, with each mesh link's model
and each collider placed at rest. It warns when the model spills out of its bounds (an off-centre import,
stale bounds, a missing `bottom`), when a collider sits well outside the model, or when nothing collides. A rig
with no `bounds` takes the box its box, cylinder and cone links fill at rest. One with a model, label or leg link,
an array or an incline can't be measured that way and gets a 1 m box, so declare its bounds.

### 2. Put it in a test scene

```
npm run add-part -- my-test ./my-part oip.roller-conveyor oip.box --place
```

This creates `my-test/` if needed, bakes your part into the project, and checks that the built-ins
you name exist (`npm run catalog` lists the ids). `--place` drops one of each at the origin; then set each
part's `position` in `scene.json`.

`--scaffold` instead of `--place` lays out a straight line through the editor's snap engine (code:
[lineScaffold.ts](../src/core/lineScaffold.ts)):

- Conveyors end to end along +X from x = 0 at a 0.8 m stand height, in argument order.
- Guard devices (sensors) on the +Z guard facing across the belt, one 0.6 m before the discharge (several spread
  from the infeed to there); `--at` x picks a device's spot along the line.
- Buttons on the -Z frame near the infeed; a spawner above the infeed; a sink on the floor past the discharge;
  cargo on the first belt; anything else on the floor beside the line.

It wires only the tags its program and starter test use, with unique names (`Belt1Run`, `DischargeEye`,
`StartPB` / `StopPB`, `Spawner1Run`); a tag named in `--params` keeps its name, and other tag params stay blank.
If the project has no program, it writes `plc/program.st` (listed in the manifest's `program`): a Start/Stop latch that starts
stopped, running the conveyors while latched. It never overwrites an existing program; it prints the
declarations to add instead. With a conveyor and something on it (cargo or a source) it writes
`tests/starter.test.json`, which presses Start and checks the line was stopped before and that a box then
physically moves (reaches the discharge eye, rides the belt, or is fed on). Replace it with what your part must
do. Without a conveyor and cargo it writes no test and says why.

The project holds a copy of your part. After editing, rerun `npm run add-part -- my-test ./my-part` (no
`--place`) to refresh it, or edit `my-test/parts/<id>/` directly and treat that as the source. A part written as a
`part.js` is copied as its built files, so build it first: `add-part` refuses a folder whose built files are not what
its `part.js` builds.

Frame conventions to place parts by (confirm any part's with `check-part` on its example folder; the
footprint is part-local):

| Part | Origin | Flow |
|---|---|---|
| roller conveyor, turntable | centre of the conveying surface (bed top at y = 0) | +X |
| belt conveyor | tail end of the surface (spans x = 0 … length) | +X |
| blade stop, chain transfer | on the conveying surface it mounts to | spans Z, across the host's +X flow |
| box, pallet | centre of the load | none |

A conveyor's footprint reads y1 = 0.05: that is a selection pad above the surface, not geometry. Place a
conveyor at `[x, standHeight, z]`, a device on it at the same y, and a box on it at y + half its height.

### 3. Say what "works" means

Write a PLC program and a test in `tests/`. The program is the files under `plc/` that `project.json` lists in
`program`, joined in that order ([projects.md](projects.md#the-program-as-files-format-7)); `add-part --scaffold`
starts one in `plc/program.st`. The simplest form is bare declarations and statements, whose variables are the
scene's tags by name. A program that is one `PROGRAM … END_PROGRAM` also answers to bare names, but two or more
PROGRAMs and nothing else do not, and `check-wiring` warns that nothing reaches the parts' tags
([DEVICE-IO.md](../src/plc/DEVICE-IO.md#a-program-wholly-inside-one-program-bare-names-too)):

```
VAR_INPUT
  Release : BOOL;   (* a tag the test stimulates, or a part publishes *)
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
  Extend : BOOL;    (* a tag the program drives: this is what makes an autoWhenDriven part obey *)
END_VAR

Extend := NOT Release;
```

```jsonc
// tests/blocks.test.json
{
  "name": "Extended blade stops the box",
  "duration": 8,
  "checks": [
    { "eventually": true, "within": 6, "tag": "AtStop", "equals": true },
    // nothing got past the blade: no cargo in the zone downstream of it, for the whole run
    { "always": true, "max": 0, "probe": { "count": { "zone": { "min": [0.52, 0, -1], "max": [5, 3, 1] } } } },
    { "at": 8, "near": 0.185, "tolerance": 0.05, "probe": { "pose": { "part": "box1", "axis": "x" } } }
  ]
}
```

The spec format is in [project-tests.md](project-tests.md). Four traps:

- An `autoWhenDriven` tag param only takes over the device when a **program output** drives it (that is what
  `ctx.tagDriven` means). A test `inputs` entry on it leaves the device on its hand state. Drive it from the
  program (`Extend := NOT Release;`) and stimulate the program's inputs.
- `eventually … equals false` passes at t = 0 when the tag starts false, and `test-project` marks that pass with a
  warning. Check a transition with `at:` after it has had time to happen, or check `true` first.
- Probe a joint directly: `"probe": { "joint": { "part": "stop", "joint": "lift" } }` reads the last value the
  part commanded (latched between commands, clamped to the joint's limits). It is absent until the part first
  commands it, so a mistyped name fails as "never appeared" instead of reading 0.
- List the tests in `project.json` `"tests"`: the app runs only the listed ones. `test-project` runs every
  `tests/*.test.json`, listed or not, and notes each one the app will not run. So keep a control you expect to fail
  out of `tests/` (a `controls/` folder), or it turns the run red.

### 4. Run it, and run a control

Run `npm run validate-project -- my-test`, then `npm run test-project -- my-test`. Then break the one thing
the test claims to prove (`"collision": "none"` on the blade, or a stroke of 0) and confirm the test fails. A
test that still passes with its cause removed measures something else. `check-wiring` and `check-layout` do
the same for tags and seating.

### 5. The two things tests can't see

**Snapping.** `npm run snap-part -- ./my-part --onto oip.roller-conveyor` asks the editor's snap engine where
your part seats on a host and which params the snap fits (a track's width, a sensor's range). It also reports
what the connection does once committed: a railing gap or deck notch, the lift that raises it flush, a guard
opening where a conveyor meets another's side. `--at x,y,z` and `--rot <deg>` set where and at what yaw the
drop is proposed; `--json` prints JSON.

**Looks.** `npm run shot-part -- ./my-part [--pose lift=0]` renders the part through the real renderer from
four sides, at rest and posed, as PNGs: use it for a texture, a carve or a lamp, which no probe reads.
`--params k=v,...` sets instance params first, `--focus x,y,z,r` frames a close-up of a part-local sphere, and
`--out <dir>` picks the folder (default `<part>/shots/`).

For maintainers: `npm run sdk-usage` counts how many first-party parts use each SDK field and `ctx` member.

## Geometry, tier by tier

### Code or a model? Decide first

Build engineered hardware in code (rig primitives and `geometry()`) when either holds:

- You could describe it: plates, rails, tubes, brackets, bolts, housings of boxes and cylinders. Code stays
  readable, diffable and testable, and anyone can change it, including an agent that can read a GLB but not
  edit one.
- Code needs its shape: a param changes it (a length, stroke, lane count), something depends on its dimensions
  (a snap, a mating part), or the rig would otherwise need the model's node names and scale factors.

Keep a model when its appearance is the asset: a photo texture, baked detail maps (a robot arm), a vendor's
CAD, building scenery.

Worked conversions from GLB to code: the conveyor roller (`rollerTemplate` in
[_shared/rollerBed.js](../examples/parts/_shared/rollerBed.js)), the Blade Stop
([blade-stop](../examples/parts/blade-stop/part.js)), the chain-transfer lane
([chain-transfer](../examples/parts/chain-transfer/part.js)), the Push Button
([push-button](../examples/parts/push-button/part.js): housing, bezel, slotted bolts, a lit cap on
the link the press moves), the six-axis robot's suction tool
([six-axis-robot](../examples/parts/six-axis-robot/part.js), built at the size the tool params ask for; the
arm keeps its model), and the diverter, built from `divertDistance`
([diverter](../examples/parts/diverter/behavior.ts)). The cargo box and pallet are drawn by the host:
[cargoBoxMesh.ts](../src/render/parts/cargoBoxMesh.ts) and [palletMesh.ts](../src/render/parts/palletMesh.ts),
textured by [build-box-textures.mjs](../scripts/build-box-textures.mjs) and
[build-pallet-textures.mjs](../scripts/build-pallet-textures.mjs).

To convert a model, take its numbers with `npm run inspect-glb`, prove the result renders the same
(`npm run shot-part` before and after, diffed pixel for pixel; match what renders, since a GLB can carry
geometry that never draws), and pin its dimensions in a test.

Don't copy a manufacturer's product. Design a generic housing of the same kind and keep only its interface,
the numbers the rest of the app is placed against. The sensor housings
([sensorPhotoeye.js](../examples/parts/_shared/sensorPhotoeye.js), and the laser's in
[its part.js](../examples/parts/laser-sensor/part.js)) keep the height, footprint, lens face and materials,
not the vendor's styling, and tests pin that interface against the drawn geometry
(`diffuseSensorRigParity.test.ts`).

Load time and draw cost are not reasons either way; see
[procedural-geometry.md](procedural-geometry.md#code-or-model-when-a-part-uses-geometry-and-when-a-glb).

### The smallest conveyor

A rig with one box link marked `conveys: true` is a powered conveying slab. With `ctx.setSurfaceVelocity`
it is a conveyor in about 10 lines. The manifest:

```json
{
  "id": "acme.powered-deck",
  "name": "Powered Deck",
  "category": "Equipment",
  "geometry": {
    "kind": "rig",
    "links": [{ "name": "deck", "shape": { "kind": "box", "size": [6, 0.1, 1] }, "offset": [0, -0.05, 0], "conveys": true }],
    "joints": [],
    "bounds": { "length": 6, "width": 1, "top": 0.05, "bottom": -0.1 }
  }
}
```

The behavior (`behavior.js`, no imports; the runtime injects `definePart`):

```js
definePart({
  params: {
    speed: { type: 'number', default: 0.6, min: 0, max: 4, step: 0.1, label: 'Speed', unit: 'm/s',
      desc: 'Surface speed along the flow arrow. 0 stops the deck; cargo on it stops with it.' },
    reverse: { type: 'boolean', default: false, label: 'Reverse',
      desc: 'Run against the flow arrow.' },
  },
  // every fixed sim tick; deterministic, so no Date or Math.random
  step(ctx) {
    const s = ctx.params.speed * (ctx.params.reverse ? -1 : 1)
    ctx.setSurfaceVelocity({ x: ctx.forward.x * s, y: 0, z: ctx.forward.z * s })
  },
})
```

Give every param a `desc` (see [Params](#params)); it is the Inspector's hover text.

To be a conveyor to its neighbours (guard openings where another conveyor butts it, end-to-end and
side-merge snapping, deck merging), declare it in the manifest:

```jsonc
"conveyor": { "surface": "roller", "speedParam": "speed" }
```

- `bed` is the shape neighbours meet. The fixed-size deck has none. Each kind names the handle or joint that
  gives its geometry, and a missing one is a validation error:
  - `'straight'`: sized by `face` handles on its length and width params;
  - `'spur'`: a straight bed whose length handle names splay angles;
  - `'path'`: a bent belt edited by a `path` handle;
  - `'arc'`: a curve swept by an `arc` handle;
  - `'turntable'`: a revolute joint turning a cylinder deck.

  To give the deck `"bed": "straight"`, add `length` and `width` params with
  `handle: { kind: 'face', axis: 'x' }` and `{ kind: 'face', axis: 'z' }`, and size the deck from them with
  `sizeParams`. Omit `bed` for any part that conveys but is not a conveyor to its neighbours.
- `surface` is the grip: `'belt'` when cargo rests on a surface that moves with it (belt, slats, mat-top
  chain), `'roller'` when it rides over rollers or wheels.
- `speedParam` names the number param the host reads outside your tick (belt scroll, roller spin, the flow
  arrow, the pilot riding the surface, the spawner-interlock seed before the first tick). Any name works.
- `reverseParam` names a hidden boolean the snap flips to turn a curve's flow around.

### Tier 1: `rig` (links and joints)

A rig is a flat list of links, each `{ name, parent?, shape, offset, rotation?|quat? }`, plus joints
(`revolute` | `prismatic`, with axis and limits) that behaviors command by name.

- `cosmetic: true` on a joint the behavior drives purely from its own state (rolling wheels, a piston
  tracking a lift). The rig gizmo skips it (no ring, never the IK end-effector), and the idle `pose` row
  indexes only the author-posable axes. The SDK AGV's wheels and piston are the reference.
- `rest: { param, scale?, add? }` on a joint the behavior slews to one param's value and holds, in the joint's
  native unit (the turntable's `{ param: 'deckAngleDeg', scale: π/180 }`). The host can then mirror the
  settled pose (the pilot's surface-carry direction on a held deck) without running the behavior.

`posable: true` on the rig geometry opts the part into the **teach-by-pose gizmo**: joint rings and an IK
end-effector handle, shown when the placed part is selected and the sim is stopped. Hovering a handle names
the joint and shows its angle; a joint with limits draws only the arc it can reach. On an arm ending in a
three-joint wrist, dragging the end-effector keeps the tool's orientation; hold Alt to let it turn. A dragged
pose is jogging, not an edit: the Inspector says the arm is jogged and offers Reset, and nothing is saved
until Inspector → **Capture Pose** records it (robot, gantry, AGV lift). Leave `posable` off when the sim or
PLC drives the joints (safety gate, diverter, blade stop, turntable); they articulate the same, without a pose
gizmo. Link-offset gizmos are separate and always available in the Part Editor.

Shape kinds:

| Shape | What it is |
|---|---|
| `box`, `cylinder` | primitives with collision; `sizeParams` makes axes track a param |
| `cone` | render-only (no collision, cargo passes through); apex +Y, rotate the link to point it down. A schematic cue like the spawner's drop marker; pair with the link's `opacity` |
| `frame` | transform-only pivot: a joint origin, no geometry |
| `mesh` | a GLB (embedded or url asset). See [Mesh links](#mesh-links) below |
| `label` | canvas text plane (`text`, `textParam`, or `textFrom` for a live caption the behavior publishes with `ctx.display`) |
| `leg` | the app's trestle leg row, host-built |

There is no chain or roller shape kind. Draw a chain lane in `geometry()` with a scrolling `MeshPart.scroll` (as
[chain-transfer](../examples/parts/chain-transfer/part.js) does) and a roller bed as an instanced bank with
`spin` (shared code in [_shared/rollerBed.js](../examples/parts/_shared/rollerBed.js)).

#### Mesh links

A `mesh` link takes per-node refs, `hideNodes` / `keepNode` carving, `fitHeight` normalising, `scale`
(uniform), `material` (one package material on every mesh) or `materials` (per GLB material), and lamps on
its remapped materials.

- A remapped package material (`materials: { "GlbMatName": "pkgMatId" }`) is PBR: `albedo` / `orm` / `normal`
  plus scalar `color` / `metalness` / `roughness`.
- `triplanar: { space, scale, boost? }` on a package material samples its `albedo` by `world` or
  `object`-space position instead of the mesh UVs. Use it when an imported GLB's UVs smear a texture along a
  long axis. `scale` is tiles per metre; `object` locks the grain to the geometry so a moving or telescoping
  part doesn't swim.
- `sizeParams` stretches the mesh along an axis by node scaling. When the model's texture repeats along that
  axis, add `tileUv: [{ axis, uv, materials }]` to re-tile instead of smear: the named UV channel of those GLB
  materials (by authored name, before the remap) is multiplied by the stretch factor. The Gantry's legs and
  rails do this on `Trim`, whose `u` runs 0..1 along the 4 m authored span, so the bolt holes keep their
  spacing on a 20 m frame. List only materials whose UVs repeat along the axis; an island sampling one spot
  of an atlas (an end cap) would wander off it.
- Its lamps are the link's `lamps`, each naming the remapped material it lights. A panel whose lenses share
  a node carries one lamp per lens: `hideNodes` / `keepNode` carve by node and cannot split one mesh's
  materials.

#### Link fields

Every field is data the host reads; no field changes what another means.

| Look | |
|---|---|
| `color` | flat tint, linear r,g,b (convert sRGB values first) |
| `colorParam` | a `type: 'color'` param whose `#rrggbb` tints the link live: a primitive's albedo; on a `mesh` link with one lamp, that lamp's material (unlit base and lit colour, the push button's `Button color`); else the link's single `material` override |
| `finish` | one of the host's textured materials, the set a drawn submesh also takes: `'frame'`, `'guard'`, `'leg'`, `'bolt'` (steel), `'gapfill'` (steel tinted white), `'roller'` (brushed roller metal, spun by the conveyor's speed), `'belt'` (scrolling fabric), `'tread'` (steel tread plate: stairs, access platforms), `'deck'` (solid concrete: an equipment platform), `'mesh'` (plain dark neutral). `tread` and `deck` tile per metre from the box's resolved size (in world space on a drawn submesh). A finish is only a look; it switches on no behavior |
| `finishParam` | an `'enum'` param whose option values are finishes; the instance's choice is the link's finish, and `finish` shows when the param holds none (the platform's "Deck surface"). `check-part` flags an option that is not a finish |
| `metalness`, `roughness` | render-only PBR (0..1) for a `color` / `colorParam` primitive |
| `opacity` | idle translucency `(0, 1]` for a `color` / `colorParam` primitive, so it reads as a schematic cue (the spawner's drop cone, a light-curtain plane). Not a lamp's `opacity`, which is a lit lens |
| `outline` | wireframe edges drawn over a primitive's fill, linear r,g,b (gives a translucent link definition) |
| `hidden` | not drawn, still solid |

| Body | |
|---|---|
| `collision` | omitted = the shape's default (`box` / `cylinder` collide as themselves; `mesh`, `cone`, `frame`, `label`, `leg` do not). `'none'` = drawn but never solid (a roller bed's rollers, where the conveying box is the real surface). `{ box: [x, y, z] }` on a `mesh` link = collide as that box, centred on the link origin |
| `conveys` | this box is a conveying surface: cargo on its top rides at the velocity the behavior sets. Under a jointed parent it follows the joint and carries its cargo along, so a vertical lift is a `conveys` deck on a prismatic joint. Turned in the part, it is built at that turn and runs on its local +Y face: a side belt is a `conveys` box stood on its edge (it grips only on a firm squeeze, since a contact up to 2 mm deep on a sideways face is ignored as a seam snag) |

| On a conveyor (`'left'` is −Z; the bed runs along +X) | |
|---|---|
| `sideGuard: 'left' \| 'right'` | a side guard wall: a conveyor butting that side opens a gap in it, a flush side merge retracts it, it merges with a collinear neighbour's guard into one wall, and it is frictionless so cargo slides along it |
| `sideRail: 'left' \| 'right'` | a below-deck side rail: retracts at a flush side merge, but a butting neighbour never opens it |
| `bed: true` | part of the bed, so cargo sliding across it from the conveying surface (a diverter kick, a load leaving a turntable lane) does not snag on its edges |

| On a deck (the link half of [part-snap-cuts.md](part-snap-cuts.md)) | |
|---|---|
| `notchable: true` | the walking deck: its box sets the deck's extent, and a neighbour's `notch` cuts a stairwell through it |
| `onEdge: 'posX' \| 'negX' \| 'posZ' \| 'negZ'` | a perimeter link (post array, rail, toe board, infill wall) on that edge: a neighbour that meets the edge and `opens` it splits its boxes and skips its posts over the gap |
| `anchor: 'floor'` | when a connection lifts the part flush onto a deck, this link stretches back down to the floor (a flight's newels and risers) |
| `dropWhenMounted: true` | while that connection holds, this link (mesh and collider) is left out and the deck takes its place (a flight's own top landing) |

| Sensing and cargo | |
|---|---|
| `beam` | a sensor ray the behavior reads with `ctx.sense`. Cast from where its link stood at the end of the last step, so an eye on a moving link moves with it ([stretch-wrapper](../examples/parts/stretch-wrapper/)'s carriage eye). It sees cargo, the walking pilot, and a box the pilot carries. Length is the static `range`, or the `number` param named in `rangeParam` (what it senses and draws; a mount's `fitRangeParam` usually names the same one). `showParam` names a boolean that hides the drawn line. The host reads no param by its name: a param called `maxRange` does nothing until a beam names it. `axis` is the link-local direction (default +Z); `tint: 'hit'` colours a blocked beam with the cargo's tint instead of red (the colour sensor) |
| `zone` | a cargo volume for `ctx.zone` / `ctx.despawn`. Never counts the pilot or a box the pilot carries |
| `loadCell` | this box link is a weighing platform, read with `ctx.weight` in kg. The host measures the force from the physics: each body resting on the link and everything stacked on it, at its own mass and with its vertical acceleration, so a landing or a lift starting reads high for a moment. A load on the link alone counts in full, even hanging past its edge; one that also rests on something else (a case crossing onto it, a pallet bridging two scales) is shared by where its centre of gravity falls between the two. Works on a `conveys` deck (a weigh belt) or a plain solid box (a platform scale) |
| `grip` | a gripper link's pickup volume: `{ zone: { size, offset?, sizeParams? } }` (an oriented box in the link's frame) or `{ radius, radiusParams? }` (a reach past the link's extents; default 0.2 m). Any link can be commanded to grip; this sizes what it takes. Add `forks: { spread \| spreadParam, bladeWidth, bladeThickness }` for a fork gripper whose blades run along the link's +X; taking a pallet through a face its blades don't fit is reported on the part ([agv](../examples/parts/agv/)) |

| Lamps | |
|---|---|
| `lamps` | `[{ emissive, offColor?, name?, material?, opacity?, param? }]`, each a `ctx.lamps` entry. `emissive` is lit, `offColor` dark (default: the host's dark neutral on a primitive, the material's own colour on a mesh). `name` defaults to the link's and is unique across the rig. A primitive link carries at most one, as its own material, so it takes no `color`. On a mesh link each names the remapped GLB `material` it lights. `opacity` makes the lit state a translucent lens; `param` names a boolean that lights it at rest |
| `squash` | `{ amount, lamp? }`: a mesh link compresses along its local Y while `lamp` is lit, anchored at its rim (suction cups collapsing as the vacuum grips). A `geometry()` submesh uses `MeshPart.squash`, as the six-axis EOAT's cups do |

| Layout and motion | |
|---|---|
| `offsetParams` | param-driven placement (a hinge at `±length/2`) |
| `showParam` | a boolean param; the link exists (mesh and body) only while true. Works on arrayed links (zero instances), as with the platform's railing and support toggles |
| `array` | repeat the link: `count` (a param name) + `step` (optionally `centered`; `stepParams` makes a step axis track a param); or `distribute` along a span (`spanAdd` lengthens it past the param, so a railing just outside a deck reaches the corner; `worldPhase` pins copies to the world pitch grid so butted beds align); or a `grid` crossing two param-driven axes into an X×Z lattice (a pitch per axis, or a fixed `maxSpacing`). `grid` works on a `mesh` link too. `omitFirstParam` / `omitLastParam` name booleans that drop the end copy of a 1-D array, so butted barriers don't double a post |
| `aim` | a two-point look-at (hydraulics that stay connected as a parent moves) |

More fields, each documented in [`manifest.d.ts`](../packages/part-sdk/manifest.d.ts):

- A `sizeParams` / `offsetParams` entry (and a joint's `minParam` / `maxParam`) is `param * scale + add`, with
  optional `min` / `max` clamps for a floor or ceiling the linear map can't express (a corner section that must
  stop at the centreline on a narrow lane). `mulParam` multiplies by a second param first (the chain transfer's
  deck width = `chains` × `distance`).
- `leg` is `{ spanParam, widthParam, standParam, frameDepth, frameDepthParam?, arc? }`: a trestle row along the
  span, its height tracking the stand param; `arc: { radiusParam, sweepDeg }` fans it round a curve.
- `label` takes `size: [w, h]` (m, default 0.05 × 0.05) and `color` (the text, r,g,b 0..1, default black).
- The rig takes `inclineParam` (a degrees param that tilts the whole bed, legs regrown to the floor) and
  `maxInclineDeg` (its clamp, default 30).
- `geometry: { kind: 'cargo', cargoKind: 'box' | 'pallet' | 'tote', size }` makes the part cargo (one dynamic body
  on the built-in cargo pipeline), as [box](../examples/parts/box/) and the Containers library's
  [tote](../libraries/containers/tote/) do.
- **Cargo with its own shape:** a top-level `cargo: { friction?, massParam?, colorParam? }` on a `rig` makes the rig
  one dynamic body, as the [drum](../libraries/containers/drum/) does ([cargo-bodies.md](cargo-bodies.md)). Its collider is
  the rig's colliding links at rest: a box link is a box, and a cylinder link stays round, so a drum on its side
  rolls. Links with `collision: 'none'` are drawn only (the drum's hoops and rim). It draws as its own rig, one
  instanced batch per material for every body of the same shape. The colour param (`colorParam`, default `color`)
  tints the links that use it per body; other links keep their own colour. The rig has no joints, and its colliding
  links' bounds are centred on the origin, as every cargo is. Mass comes from `massParam` (default `mass`, else
  10 kg). A Spawner whose Product is the part spawns it as its shape.
- **What cargo is to the machines around it:** `cargo` also takes `forkPockets` (forks are checked against a block
  pallet's channels at its footprint), `heavy` (it bears loads: a firmer solver, and never counted as dropped),
  `loadBase` (a wrap starts from it and it anchors a unit load), `separateContacts` (a hollow body standing on a foot)
  and `nestDepth` (another of its shape set on it sits this many metres lower). A plastic pallet is a rig with
  `cargo: { forkPockets: true, heavy: true, loadBase: true }`. The built-in pallet and tote have these by kind
  ([cargo-bodies.md](cargo-bodies.md)).
- A top-level `thumbnail` (a data URL) is the catalog card's picture.

A roller bed draws its rollers in `geometry()` on the grid `ctx.deltas` hands it; that is how
[roller-conveyor](../examples/parts/roller-conveyor/part.js) skews its bank so cargo tracks across the bed
and squares against a side guard. See [sdk-geometry-flexibility.md](sdk-geometry-flexibility.md).

**A gripper lifts every cargo body inside its volume**, each held at its own captured offset, so the group
moves rigidly (a palletizer head taking a formed layer, a fork carrying a pallet and its stack). There is no
single/multi-pick switch: `grip.zone` is how you say how much the tool holds. Declare a zone on any gripper
wider than what it grips. The `radius` sphere (measured to the box surface, so a cup that brushes a case
still seals) suits a tool no bigger than one load; on a plate it would lift whatever stands beside the target.
Use the zone's `offset` when the tool engages away from its frame: the AGV's volume sits 1.1 m out on the
tines. A pallet's collider is solid, so the tines never enter it. `forkPockets` only checks that the fork spread
fits the face.

### Tier 2: `geometry(g, params, ctx)` (procedural)

Use this for shapes a rig can't express (a belt lofted along a bent path, an arc bed). It is a pure function
from params to meshes, rerun on a param edit and never per tick.

Basic ops: `g.sweep(profile, path)`, `g.fillet`, `g.arc`, `g.box`, `g.merge`, and raw `g.surface()` as the
escape hatch.

Solid-shape ops for engineered hardware (the [push-button](../examples/parts/push-button/part.js) and
[blade-stop](../examples/parts/blade-stop/part.js) are built from them):

- `g.bevelBox(size, center, bevel, square?)`: a machined block, edges chamfered except where it sits flush.
- `g.lathe(profile, { axis, segments, smooth })`: anything turned (a knob, bezel, roller, or a hex bolt with
  `smooth: false`), from `[radius, height]` pairs walked with the outside on your right. `center` moves the
  axis; `startAngle` turns the facets.
- `g.extrude(outline, from, to, { axis, holes, bevel, square })`: a plate from any outline, with holes;
  `square` lists edges left unchamfered.
- `g.transform(desc, { scale, rotate, translate })`: author in a drawing's units and orientation, map once.
  `rotate` is a unit quaternion `[x, y, z, w]`.
- `g.loft(sections, path, { caps, frame })`: a sweep whose section changes (a hopper, funnel, tapered arm,
  round-to-square duct). Give one section per path point, or two (start and end, blended). Every section has
  the same point count, and point j joins point j of the next, so a round-to-square transition samples its
  square at the circle's point count, starting at matching corners. A section shrunk to one repeated point is
  a cone tip.
- `g.subtract(solid, ...cutters)`: cuts closed solids out of a closed solid (a bore, keyway, bolt holes, a
  slot, a pocket). The cut is lined in the solid's material, a lathed surface stays round, and a cut solid can
  be cut again. Every input must be closed and outward-facing (a sweep or loft needs `caps` and a
  counter-clockwise section), or it throws. Make a through-cut a little longer than the wall.
- `g.cylinder(radius, height, center?, { axis, segments })`: the closed cylinder a bore needs.

These ops always produce closed, outward-facing solids, flat where faces meet and round around a lathe.

Sweep options: ends are open unless you pass `{ caps: true }`, which closes each with the section (concave
too). Cap anything that visibly stops (a guard, a frame rail), or its end shows as a hollow tube. A sweep holds
its section level, which suits a deck or a spiral chute; for a path that turns vertical (a pipe bending into a
riser), pass `frame: 'transport'` so the section is carried round the bend.

A hub with a 20 mm bore and a keyway:

```js
g.subtract(
  g.lathe([[0, 0], [0.09, 0], [0.09, 0.03], [0.06, 0.05], [0.06, 0.12], [0, 0.12]], { segments: 40 }),
  g.cylinder(0.01, 0.3, [0, 0.06, 0]),
  g.box([0.006, 0.3, 0.015], [0, 0.06, 0.0125]),
)
```

For a painted look with no texture file, give a package material a `pattern` instead of an `albedo`:

```json
{ "id": "hazard", "pattern": { "kind": "stripes", "colors": [[1, 0.55, 0], [0.015, 0.015, 0.015]], "angle": 45 },
  "triplanar": { "space": "object", "scale": 4 } }
```

paints hazard stripes, four repeats per metre. `kind` is `'stripes'` (with `ratio`, the first colour's share,
and `angle`: 0, 45, 90 or 135) or `'checker'`; colours are linear r,g,b. Pair it with `triplanar` unless the
pattern should follow the mesh's UVs (one repeat per UV unit); the builder ops' UVs are not in metres.

Return `MeshPart`s with a `finish` (host material) or a package `material` id, `colorParam`, a `collision`
channel, `instances`, and `lamps: [{ name, emissive, offColor?, opacity? }]` (spelled like a link's, at most
one, since a submesh is one material). A lamp lights when the behavior sets `ctx.lamps[<name>]`; with a
`colorParam`, that param sets both the unlit colour and the glow (the
[push-button](../examples/parts/push-button/part.js)'s cap).

#### Things that move at a drive speed

Two animation channels work on any rig `geometry()` submesh. They run while the sim runs, at the speed the
behavior reports (`ctx.report`, so a program-commanded speed drives them; else the param of that name), and
hold still when it stops. Leave `speed` out on a conveyor and it is the conveyor's `speedParam`; a part that
is not a conveyor must name it (`speed: 'fanSpeed'`) or it is refused when built.

- `scroll: { tilesPerMeter, speed? }`: the submesh's copy of its material's `albedo` moves along U. Lay U out
  in texture tiles along the direction of travel (`u = metres × tilesPerMeter`); the pattern travels at
  `speed` m/s toward +U. For a chain's links, a belt's weave, a cable carrier.
- `spin: { axis, radius, center?, speed? }`: the submesh turns about `axis` through `center` at
  `speed ÷ radius` rad/s, right-handed for a positive speed. For a pulley, fan, sprocket. On an `instances`
  bank, every instance turns about its own axis (a roller bed). The host turns the material's grain rather
  than the geometry, which adds no per-frame work and sets two rules:
  - lay the template's axle along local Z through its origin (`axis` must be `[0, 0, 1]` or `[0, 0, -1]`;
    `check-part` reports anything else);
  - draw it in a material whose grain can turn: finish `'roller'`, or a package material with
    `triplanar: { space: 'object' }`. The grain is sampled in the template's own units, so a template at
    another scale shows a coarser or finer grain.

  A roller bed carrying cargo toward +X turns about `[0, 0, -1]`.

A third channel follows a lamp: `squash: { amount, lamp }` compresses the submesh along its link's Y by
`amount` (0..1] while the lamp is lit, anchored at its lowest point, and eases back when the lamp goes dark or
the sim stops. On an `instances` bank of suction cups the whole bank collapses about the rims, so the lips stay
on the load ([six-axis-robot](../examples/parts/six-axis-robot/part.js)). Rig parts only, not with `spin`.

An animated submesh never merges with its twins across parts. Examples:
[chain-transfer](../examples/parts/chain-transfer/part.js) (scrolling chain) and the roller parts, whose
tubes, axle stubs and drive bands come from [_shared/rollerBed.js](../examples/parts/_shared/rollerBed.js), joined into
[roller-conveyor](../examples/parts/roller-conveyor/part.js),
[curved-roller](../examples/parts/curved-roller/part.js),
[spur-roller-conveyor](../examples/parts/spur-roller-conveyor/part.js) and
[turntable-conveyor](../examples/parts/turntable-conveyor/part.js).

#### Making a submesh solid: the two `collision` channels

A `geometry()` submesh is decorative until it declares a channel. You say what is solid; the host decides how:

| channel | collider | for |
|---------|----------|-----|
| `collision: 'box'` | the submesh's local AABB as a yaw-placed box | boxy structure (side guards, a machine housing). A guard wall also declares `sideGuard: 'left' \| 'right'`, which is what a cross-part guard merge spans; a conveying belt builds its guards path-aware instead (per-run walls split at openings) |
| `collision: 'hull'` | a convex hull of the submesh's vertices | anything an AABB misrepresents: a round pillar, a ramp, a chamfered plinth. The submesh must be convex (split a concave solid into several submeshes). Never merged, so don't use it for guards |

A hulled submesh past the host's hull-point cap falls back to its AABB box, so hull the simple shape, not a
dense visual mesh. Example: [shape](../examples/parts/shape/behavior.ts), whose box/cylinder/cone/ramp
primitives are each one convex, hulled submesh.

#### Repeated hardware: `MeshPart.instances` (instanced templates)

When a submesh is many copies of one small shape (leg pieces, bolts, railing posts, rack uprights), give the
`MeshPart` `instances: InstanceTransform[]`. The host draws its `desc` as a unit template at each
`{ position, scale?, quaternion? }`: one draw call regardless of count. Instancing is keyed on geometry
content, so the same template across different parts merges into one pool. Keep `desc` a unit shape and put
each piece's size in its `scale` (as the built-in legs' `unitBox` does) so differently sized uses share it.
It is render-only, on the part root. (Tier 1's `array` repeats a primitive; `instances` is the Tier 2
equivalent for arbitrary geometry and transforms.) Example: [bollards](../examples/parts/bollards/behavior.ts),
one unit-cylinder template drawn as a row of scaled posts.

**Never mirror an instance with a negative `scale` component.** It reverses that copy's triangle winding, so
with the host's double-sided materials it is lit as if seen from inside, visibly a different colour from its
twin, and nothing warns. For the far side of a symmetric piece, anchor it at its far end with a 180° turn
instead; for a constant cross-section extrusion that is the identical solid and keeps one pooled template. The
belt conveyor's `steelPiece` does this, and
[instanceMirror.test.ts](../src/render/parts/instanceMirror.test.ts) checks the whole catalog.

An instance may carry `data: number[]`, per-instance values the host interprets per finish (never the
transform). Only `finish: 'belt'` banks read it: `[uMul, uAdd, vMul?, vAdd?]`.

- The u pair (metres) rebuilds belt-loop arc length from the template's local `u` (`u·uMul + uAdd`). The
  straight belt conveyor's scrolling bed is two pooled unit templates (a 1 m strip and a drum-wrap band) with
  the weave continuous across pieces; see the bed section of
  [belt-conveyor](../examples/parts/belt-conveyor/part.js).
- The v pair (default `[1, 0]`) remaps cross-belt `v` (`v·vMul + vAdd`) for an instance that is a slice of the
  belt width, as the spur conveyor's staircased strips do
  ([spur-conveyor](../examples/parts/spur-conveyor/part.js)).

#### Dressing a rig link: `MeshPart.link` (Tier 1 × Tier 2)

A `kind: 'rig'` part's `geometry()` may tag a `MeshPart` with `link: '<rigLinkName>'`; the host attaches it to
that link, so procedural geometry follows the link's joint and rest pose. Untagged submeshes sit on the rig root.
Rig links still own their colliders, so `geometry()` here is render-only. The usual pattern is a `hidden` box
link (collision only) dressed by a procedural mesh. The SDK **Fence** and **Safety Gate** do this: a hidden
collision box (a full-span barrier, or a swinging leaf) plus a wire-mesh grid and e-stop from `geometry()`,
with the leaf's mesh tagged `link: 'leaf'` so it swings with the hinge. See
[fence](../examples/parts/fence/part.js) and [safety-gate](../examples/parts/safety-gate/part.js).

#### Geometry that has to meet a neighbour: the third argument, `ctx: GeometryContext`

Params can't see where the part was dropped. For end-of-bed geometry that must line up with whatever is
butted against it, the host passes what it resolved:

```js
geometry(g, p, ctx) {
  var c = ctx || {}
  // c.deltas - the world-phase roller grid this bed landed on (part-local +X); c.pitch - its spacing
  // c.butt   - { head, tail }: does that end abut a collinear neighbour at all?
}
```

`deltas` comes from any link whose `array.distribute` is `worldPhase`. On the roller conveyor that is a
`frame` link that exists only to declare the grid, so the host can resolve it across butted beds. Two butted
beds share one world pitch grid, so `deltas` also locates the neighbour's rollers: the next grid line past your
head is `deltas[last][0] + pitch`. `butt` says whether anything is there at all. The shipped case is the roller
conveyor's skew transfer plate: it replaces the rollers the skew clips away, laps across a butt seam to the
neighbour roller's face, and stays flush at a free end
([roller-conveyor](../examples/parts/roller-conveyor/part.js)).

Every field is optional and `ctx` may be empty (a headless call passes nothing), so write the placement-free
geometry first and let `ctx` refine it. Stay deterministic: same `(params, ctx)`, same mesh.

### Snapping (`snap` in the manifest)

The manifest's `snap` declares how the part connects to others:

- **`mounts`** seats a device on a host surface (a sensor or diverter onto a conveyor guard), with `yOffset` /
  `outwardOffset` standoffs and `fitRangeParam` auto-fitting a beam range across the belt.
  - `accepts: 'face'` seats on the nearest vertical face of any part's footprint box. Every part advertises its
    four side faces, and the seat is 2-D: it slides along the face and in height with the drag, clamped to the
    face (a push button or HMI panel on a cabinet's flank; see
    [push-button/part.js](../examples/parts/push-button/part.js)).
  - `attach: true` soft-parents the device under its host on commit, so moving the host carries it (detach is
    the tree's "Unparent").
  - `mounts` is a list and every entry is tried. The best fit is taken, whatever the declaration order. A device that seats
    on several kinds of host (a guard rail, or flat on a bracket face) declares one mount per `accepts`.
  - `opens: true` on a mount onto `conveyorGuard` cuts the guard where it mounts (the diverter).
  - `face: 'in' | 'out'`: local +Z faces toward the host (a sensor's beam, the default) or away (a diverter's
    body, a wall-mounted button).
- **`track`** seats the part on a roller conveyor's bed, anchored to the roller grid (a blade stop rising
  between rollers). `fitWidthParam` fits its width to the host bed (times `fitWidthScale`), `targetLocalY`
  seats it above (or, negative, recessed into) the bed surface, and `lanes: { countParam, pitchParam? }`
  anchors N parallel lanes, each in a roller gap (the chain transfer).
- **`surfaces`** is the host half: a non-conveyor part advertises a mountable rail
  (`{ kind: 'conveyorGuard', lengthParam, widthParam }`) that a device's `mounts.accepts` matches, so a sensor
  can mount on a stand or bracket. See [part-snap-surfaces.md](part-snap-surfaces.md).
- **`tile`** tiles a part edge-to-edge with same-`group` parts (`{ group, lengthParam, widthParam, cornerFlush? }`):
  floor markings, decks. See [part-snap-edges.md](part-snap-edges.md).
- **`chain`** chains a linear part end-to-end with same-`group` parts
  (`{ group, lengthParam, reach, omitStartParam?, omitEndParam? }`): barrier collinear-extend and L-corner with a
  shared post. See [part-snap-chain.md](part-snap-chain.md).
- **`edgeMount`** seats a part on a host deck edge, which the host advertises as a `surfaces` entry of that
  `kind` (`{ accepts, alongParam, reach, outwardOffset?, facing?, at?, atParams?, fromFloor?, opens?, notch?, lift? }`).
  Facing `'along'` (the default) is a barrier on the rim. Facing `'into'` is a flight, ramp or ladder whose `at`
  point sits on the edge, standing on the deck's floor with `fromFloor` (the host fits that param so the
  contact reaches the deck; the deck's `surfaces` entry adds the `heightParam` it reads). `opens` cuts the
  railing where it meets the edge, `notch` holes a deck it passes through, `lift` raises it flush. The shipped
  stairs work this way; see [part-snap-cuts.md](part-snap-cuts.md) and
  [part-snap-edge-mount.md](part-snap-edge-mount.md).

[part-snap-connectors.md](part-snap-connectors.md) shows every kind as the connector it compiles to, the one rule
that ranks them (a part declaring several uses whichever fits the drop best), and the golden table any engine
change must keep unchanged.

**`flush: true`** is ambient face-flush for parts that get tiled: dragged near another part, the footprint seats
flush against that part's nearest face (90°-stepped orientation, slide and corner-flush along the face, height
untouched). With Shift-drag duplicate it makes rows fast; see
[rack](../examples/parts/rack/part.js). Flush engages within 0.75 m, so it belongs only on parts
bigger than that (a 5.4 × 1.1 rack, not a 0.6 × 0.4 box, which would jump flush from 0.7 m away).

A part with no snap declarations never snaps on its own. Users can still place any part against any face: during
a Shift+G reposition, holding **Alt** face-snaps the part onto the surface under the cursor (walls, flanks,
inclined faces at the picked height; X/Y/Z pick the alignment axis, Shift for negative; scroll rotates). So
declare `flush` only when tiling is the part's everyday gesture.

## Bring your own model (GLB)

A model becomes a working part as a rig (Tier 1) whose visible links are `mesh` shapes. In the browser,
**Import model…** on a rig node embeds it. Headless, follow the steps below. The per-field rules are the
`RigMeshShape` docs in [`manifest.d.ts`](../packages/part-sdk/manifest.d.ts).

### Formats

The app reads **GLB** (Draco-compressed is fine) and **STEP** (`.step` / `.stp`). **Import model…** converts
STEP to GLB: it reads the file's units, turns its up axis into +Y, and sets the model on the node's origin
(base at 0, centred across). It offers four choices first:

- **Up axis**: STEP records none, so it is preselected from the exporting program in the header (Y for
  SolidWorks and Inventor; Z for CATIA, NX, Creo, Solid Edge, Onshape and FreeCAD; Z when the file went through
  a converter). If the model arrives on its side, pick the other axis.
- **Detail**: coarse has about half the triangles.
- **Skip parts under N mm**: screws and washers, often a third of an assembly's solids.
- **Merge by colour**: a handful of meshes instead of one per solid. Turn it off to keep each solid as a named
  node you can split out.

A large assembly takes about 2 s per MB of STEP. Headless, `npm run import-model -- model.step` runs the same
conversion to `model.glb`, with the same choices as options (`--up z|y`, `--detail coarse`, `--min-part-mm <n>`,
`--no-merge`) and the up axis guessed from the header when `--up` is not given. Convert anything else first:

- `.gltf` + separate files → `npx gltf-transform copy model.gltf model.glb` (in this repo's devDependencies).
- OBJ → `npx gltfpack -i model.obj -o model.glb` (also in the devDependencies).
- FBX → Blender (`blender -b -P` with an import + `export_scene.gltf(export_format='GLB')`; on Windows the
  binary is usually `C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender <version>\blender.exe`, not on PATH), or FBX2glTF.
- STL → the same, but an STL is one mesh with no nodes and no units. Split the moving pieces into separate,
  named objects in Blender first (nothing can be rigged otherwise), and check the scale.
- IGES → tessellate in a CAD tool (FreeCAD, CAD Assistant) and export GLB with the assembly's named parts.

### 1. Read the model

`npm run inspect-glb -- model.glb` prints the node tree: each node's name (what `hideNodes` / `keepNode` /
`node` take), its local transform, its materials (keys for a `materials` remap or a lamp's `material`), and
the world-space box of its subtree. Use it to decide which nodes move, where their pivot or travel axis is, and
where the part's origin goes (see the frame conventions in [Verify it headless](#verify-it-headless); a device
on a conveyor has its origin on the conveying surface). glTF is metres and +Y up; the part's length runs along
local +X.

### 2. Embed it

Add the GLB to the manifest's `assets` as base64 so the part stays self-contained:

```js
// node -e "…" > asset.json, then paste into manifest.json "assets"
const data = require('fs').readFileSync('model.glb').toString('base64')
console.log(JSON.stringify([{ id: 'model', mime: 'model/gltf-binary', data }]))
```

(`url: "/models/Foo.glb"` instead of `data` is for first-party parts that reuse an app-served file.)

### 3. Carve it into links

Use whole-scene refs (no `node`) and carve with `hideNodes` / `keepNode`. Carved pieces keep identical scale
and placement, so they line up without transcribing any transform.

```jsonc
"links": [
  // the static body: everything except the moving nodes
  // offset -0.2 on x: inspect-glb says the model spans x 0..0.4, and `bounds` is centred on the origin
  { "name": "base", "shape": { "kind": "mesh", "asset": "model", "hideNodes": ["BladeMiddle", "BladeCornerL", "BladeCornerR"] }, "offset": [-0.2, 0, 0] },
  // the joint lives on a transform-only frame; the moving mesh hangs under it at offset 0
  { "name": "carriage", "shape": { "kind": "frame" }, "offset": [-0.2, 0, 0] },
  { "name": "blade", "parent": "carriage", "offset": [0, 0, 0],
    "shape": { "kind": "mesh", "asset": "model", "hideNodes": ["BaseMiddle", "BaseCornerL", "BaseCornerR", "AirPressureL", "AirPressureR"] } },
  // what cargo actually hits: hidden primitive boxes sized off the inspect-glb boxes
  { "name": "bladeCollider", "parent": "carriage", "shape": { "kind": "box", "size": [0.05, 0.25, 2] }, "offset": [0.104, 0.123, 0], "hidden": true }
],
"joints": [{ "name": "lift", "link": "carriage", "type": "prismatic", "axis": [0, 1, 0], "min": -0.25, "max": 0 }]
```

The joint's 0 is the pose the model was authored in. This model has its blade up, so the stroke runs down
(`min: -0.25`): the behavior sets `lift` to 0 to block and -0.25 to retract. Check which way yours was drawn
from the `inspect-glb` boxes before choosing the range.

- `keepNode` keeps one node's subtree. A moving piece made of several sibling nodes needs `hideNodes` listing
  everything else, as above.
- A `node` ref (one node's mesh in its mesh-local frame, its transform reset) is for re-assembling pieces
  yourself, like a robot's links. You then transcribe each node's transform into the link's `offset` /
  `rotation`, the work carving avoids.
- For a revolute pivot away from the origin, put the frame at the pivot and the mesh under it at the negated
  offset, so the mesh stays put at rest and swings about the pivot.
- `fitHeight` rescales and re-centres the model (height, XZ-centred, underside at y = 0) when the vendor's units
  or origin are wrong. Carving still lines up, because it applies to the whole scene first.
- **Collision:** a mesh link is visual-only. `collision: { box: [x, y, z] }` on it is centred on the link
  origin, not the mesh: right for a mesh centred on its link, wrong for an off-centre vendor mesh. The reliable
  form is the one above: hidden `box` links placed from the `inspect-glb` world boxes.
- `bounds` is the footprint box `{ length, width, top, bottom? }`, centred on the origin in X and Z, spanning y
  from `bottom` (default 0) to `top` in the part's frame. Put the origin at the model's XZ centre: offset the
  top-level links by minus the centre `inspect-glb` reports (as above), or use `fitHeight`. `check-part`'s
  footprint and the model's box should then agree. If the model hangs below the origin (a device whose origin
  is the belt surface), give a negative `bottom` so a floor drop rests the underside on the floor. (A cargo box
  states its centred `size` instead.)
- When the origin is a mount point, give the box's centre with `centerX` / `centerZ` (m from the origin). When
  the part's size is a param, tie the box to it with `bounds.params`: each entry sets one field (`length`,
  `width`, `top`, `bottom`, `centerX`, `centerZ`) to a linear map of a param, with the same rule as
  `sizeParams` (`param`, `scale`, `add`, `mulParam`, `min`, `max`). Snapping, selection and drop-rest then see
  the part at every setting. The [diverter](../examples/parts/diverter/rig.json) does both: its origin sits
  toward the guard it mounts on, its length and centre follow its stroke, and its bottom follows its stand
  height.
- A `face` handle takes over its axis: a param with `handle: { kind: 'face', axis: 'x' }` IS the footprint's length
  (`'z'` its width, `'y'` its height), whatever `bounds` says. So hardware past the body the handle sizes (a ramp, an
  indicator head) is outside the footprint. Leave the handle off a param that is not the whole extent, and tie
  `bounds` to it with `bounds.params` instead.

### 4. Behavior and verify

Drive the joint from a tag as a primitive rig does (`ctx.setJoint`, gated on `tagDriven`; see
[Behavior](#behavior-the-ctx-surface)). Then run `npm run check-part` (the footprint should match the
`inspect-glb` whole-model size) and the rest of [Verify it headless](#verify-it-headless).

## Params

Params are declared in `definePart({ params: { … } })`. The Inspector renders them, instances override them,
and `ctx.params.*` reads them typed. A `ctx.params.<name>` the script reads that it does not declare is refused at
its line (with the near name, for a typo), since it would read `undefined` with no error; a `.js` behavior has no
types to catch it. The check reads the source, so a read through a destructured or renamed `ctx.params` is not seen.

| Type | Renders as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `number` | slider/field | `min` / `max` / `step`, `unit`. With both `min` and `max` it is a slider; without them it is typed or stepped, so give an unbounded size a viewport handle instead. `unit: '%'` stores a fraction (0 to 1) and shows a percentage. See units below |
| `boolean` | toggle | |
| `string` | text field | |
| `tag` | PLC tag picker | autocompletes from the scene's tags. Use it for every tag-name param |
| `numberList` | typed grid | fixed `arity` per row; arrives as `number[][]` (waypoints, poses). See below |
| `color` | swatch | `#rrggbb`. `list: true` makes a row of swatches with add / remove; the value stays a `string` of `#rrggbb` entries joined by commas (`''` = none). `alpha: true` adds an A slider and makes the value `#rrggbbaa` |
| `enum` | dropdown | options can carry `rows` + `stamps: '<numberList param>'` to stamp templates |
| `partRef` | dropdown of the scene's parts | another part's id (`''` = unset; a dangling id is inert). Read the conveyor it names with `ctx.conveyorRunning(id)` (the spawner's interlock) |

`numberList` options:

- On a jointed rig whose joint count matches the row width, the grid offers **Capture Pose**: pose the arm with
  the viewport gizmo and it appends the posed joint row (revolute °, prismatic m).
- `columns: ['x m', 'z m', '°']` heads the cells.
- `rows: 1` fixes the row count (no Add / Remove; Capture Pose sets the row), for one multi-number value such as
  an idle pose.
- An arity-1 list with `rowsOf: '<numberList param>'` is a set of that table's row indices, shown as a checkbox
  per row (the robot's `blendWaypoints`).
- `rowNames: '<string param>'` names the rows, one per line (declare that param `hidden`). The grid edits names
  in place and every param pointing at the table shows them. Removing a row renumbers what points past it and
  marks what pointed at it missing; it never re-points it at a neighbour.
- `program: { names, ops }` makes the rows the steps of numbered programs, `[program, op, ...args]`, edited as a
  card of readable steps per program (the robot's `jobs`). Each op has a `code`, a `label` and `args` of kind
  `row` (a row of another table, picked by name), `number` (`unit` / `min` / `max` / `step`) or `choice` (an
  option may name a `tag` param, shown beside it). `arity` must be 2 + the most args an op takes. Report the
  running row with `ctx.report(key, row)` (-1 idle) and the Inspector highlights it during a run.

**Units.** Give the unit with `unit`, not in the label: `label: 'Speed', unit: 'm/s'` shows an `m/s` suffix,
and a length or speed field converts typed units (`5ft`, `600mm`; `394 fpm` in an m/s field stores 2.0). A
trailing `(m)` in the label is also read as the unit, but only when it is exactly that: with
`'Speed (m/s, − reverses)'` the field has no unit, no suffix and no conversion (typed `394 fpm` becomes 394).
Put extra explanation in `desc`. `unit: 'rpm'`, `'°'` and `'°/s'` show as suffixes without converting. A
length or speed field displays in the scene's Units (a metre field reads inches in an imperial scene, an
`'FPM'` one reads m/s in a metric one); `step()` always reads the unit you declared.

**Hidden params.** `hidden: true` makes a param storage rather than a field: resolved, defaulted, clamped and
persisted, but never shown. Use it for engine-owned state the user must not hand-edit (compare `rest`, which the
host writes but still exposes for pinning). The curved conveyor's `reverse` is one: a curve can't be rotated
180° to turn its flow around (that would swap inner and outer radius), so the snap flips this flag when it butts
two ends that both discharge into the junction. Reversing by hand uses a negative `speed`. Fold the two together
in `step()`:

```js
const speed = (running ? commanded : 0) * (ctx.params.reverse ? -1 : 1)
```

These declarations change how a field is edited without changing the value the part reads:

| Field | On | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `bits: 3` or `bits: '<number param>'` | `number` | a bitmask, one checkbox per bit (the stack light's lit tiers, `bits: 'segments'`) |
| `suggest: 'marks'` | `string` | suggests the product marks the scene's parts declare (`attribute: true` params) while typing |
| `product: true` | `string` | the value is a cargo part's package id (`'oip.tote'`): a dropdown of the cargo parts, and the project holds a copy of the part named |
| `settings: 'key'` | `string` with `product` | names a hidden `string` param holding the chosen product's settings as JSON; the Inspector shows the product's own params under the dropdown |
| `values: [{ value: 1, label: 'red' }, ...]` | `INT` / `DINT` `tag` | what each code means, listed on the field and by `npm run catalog` |
| `imperialUnits: true` | `boolean` | the part's units switch (true = imperial). The scene's Units (Scene Properties) write it on every part and carry each pair of values it switches between (same-label `number` twins, and `tag` twins through `setpointFor`); the Inspector never shows it. Pair it with `whenAbsent` |

**Groups and labels.** Follow the Inspector's conventions so every part reads the same:

- The PLC switch (`commsParam`) and every `tag` param go in `group: 'Comms'`. While the switch is off the
  Inspector hides the rest of that section.
- Detail a plant program reads back but few scenes set (a conveyor's drive feedback) goes in
  `'Comms/Feedback'`. A nested section starts folded.
- A param that is only the state the device starts in, which Use then operates (a diverter's `diverted`, a
  gate's `open`), goes in `'Start state'`.
- `'Size'` for dimensions (`standHeight` stays top level; the host fills it), ordered Length, Width, Height.
- `'Guards'` for side guards and frame rails (`'Left guard'` / `'Right guard'`).
- `'Motion'` for speeds, travel limits and a moving machine's waypoint table.
- `'Colors'` once a part has two or more colours (a single colour stays top level).

A tag's label says what the signal means (`'Run tag (belt runs while true)'`), not its type or direction: the
Inspector shows `dir` + `stType` beside the field. The row shows the label up to a trailing explanatory bracket
(`Run Tag`) and the hover shows all of it, so put the name first. A bracket that starts with a unit keeps the
unit on the row (`'Speed tag (m/s)'`; `'Actual Z tag (m, down)'` shows `Actual Z Tag (m)`).

**`visibleWhen`.** `visibleWhen: { param: 'fpmUnits', is: true }` shows a param only while the named boolean
has that value: for one setting offered two ways with a switch (the conveyors carry a speed in m/s and one in
feet per minute, a speed tag for each, and only the pair in use shows). The switch may be an `'enum'`:
`is: 'waypoints'` for one mode, `is: ['position', 'follow']` for several (the Gantry's command and X/Y/Z target
tags). Each value must be one of the enum's options; `check-part` reports one that is not. Like `hidden`, this is
presentation only: both params are stored and resolved, and `step()` reads the one the switch selects. One
effect beyond the screen: a hidden tag param is not one of the part's signals while hidden, so the wiring check
does not count it.

**`whenAbsent`** (boolean params) is the value a part takes when its saved params lack the key; `default` is
what a newly placed part gets. Use it only when a new switch changes what existing numbers mean. The conveyors'
`fpmUnits` has `whenAbsent: false`, so a belt saved before the switch existed stays in m/s instead of reading
its `speedTag := 2.0` as two feet per minute; a newly dropped belt takes the scene's Units, as any
`imperialUnits` switch does. An ordinary new param needs only `default`.

**Tag params.** Every `'tag'` param declares `dir` and `stType`, or the part is refused.

- `dir` is the part's side: `'in'` when the part reads it (a program drives it, like a run command), `'out'`
  when the part writes it (a sensor's state). It lets the wiring check find a tag nothing drives, or two parts
  fighting over one.
- `stType` is `'BOOL'`, `'INT'`, `'DINT'` or `'REAL'`. `DINT` is for 32-bit whole numbers (a count, a step
  number); like a REAL it travels in a double-word address (`%QD0`).

**`desc`** is the param's doc line, shown in the hover under the label. The host adds the range and default,
so say what those can't: what the value means in the part's frame, what a toggle suppresses, which way a sign
runs, which other param it overrides. One sentence; don't restate the label, and leave it out when the label
says everything. It is user-facing copy: plain hyphens, no em dashes.

```js
randomSize: { type: 'boolean', default: false, label: 'Random size',
  desc: 'Give each box a random size and IGNORE the three dimensions above. The random range is fixed by the part, not derived from them.' },
```

Every first-party part documents every visible param, enforced by `bundledPackageData.test.ts` with no opt-out
(`hidden` params are exempt). Write the description from the code, not from what the label implies.

**Handles.** `label`, `group` (`'A/B'` nests) and `handle`, a spatial gizmo binding, add editor affordances:

- `{ kind: 'face', axis, sign? }` puts a drag dot on a face for resizing (`sign: 1 | -1` picks one face).
  `bayParam` (a sibling pitch param, optionally gated by `bayGateParam`) snaps it to whole bays, as in the
  storage rack's per-cell resize.
- `{ kind: 'path' }` is a multi-segment belt path editor; `{ kind: 'arc' }` the curved-conveyor sweep/width
  gizmo. Both also give the part real snap ends, and both name the sibling params the host derives the bed
  from:
  - `path`: `widthParam` / `heightParam` (cross-width / surface height; defaults `'width'` / `'height'`) and
    `leftGuardParam` / `rightGuardParam` (boolean guard toggles whose walls the host builds path-aware;
    defaults `'leftGuard'` / `'rightGuard'`);
  - `arc`: `innerRadiusParam` / `widthParam` (defaults `'innerRadius'` / `'width'`), `innerGuardParam` /
    `outerGuardParam` (defaults `'innerGuard'` / `'outerGuard'`), and `endGap` (the straight lead-in the snap
    ends extend past the arc, to match the stub you draw) or `endGapParam: { param, scale?, add? }`.
- `{ kind: 'rigSize', link, axis, frameY? }` puts an orange size dot on a rig link's frame. It follows the posed
  arm (unlike a `face` dot on the static footprint) and drags the param along that link axis, with a tool
  outline when an `'x'` and a `'z'` handle share the link (the six-axis EOAT resize).
- `{ kind: 'flexPath', lengthParam, sections, maxHingeDeg?, infeedBrakeParam?, dischargeBrakeParam?, scissor? }`
  on a `numberList` of `[x, z]` control points is the flex conveyor's bed of hinged sections, dragged point by
  point ([flex-conveyor](../examples/parts/flex-conveyor/part.js) and the type's docs in `index.d.ts`).

**Guard openings.** Authored side-guard openings live in the `guardOpenings` param, a param kind of its own
whose key is fixed. Rows are `[start m, end m, side ±1/0]`, measured from the tail, on either tier.
Declaring it is the opt-in, and it turns on **guard-openings mode** (G with the part selected, or "Edit in
viewport" under the table): drag along a guard to cut an opening, drag its edge dots to resize. Who consumes it
depends on the tier: a `drawn` belt cuts its own guard ribbon in `geometry()` (rows arrive in arc length along
its path), while on a `rig` part the host splits the `sideGuard` links, folding the rows in with the
neighbour-derived openings so mesh and collider cut together. See
[roller-conveyor](../examples/parts/roller-conveyor/part.js) (rig) and
[belt-conveyor](../examples/parts/belt-conveyor/part.js) (drawn).

**Leg footing.** `rest: 'surfaceBelow'` marks a param the host fills with the drop height (what auto-grows
conveyor legs). A legged part may also declare a `legRests` numberList (`[x0, x1, dy]` rows, arity 3, default
`[]`) for per-leg footing. Where a platform deck crosses under the bed (or the bed overhangs the deck it stands
on), the host fills in the intervals of local X whose surface below differs from the part's floor plane (`dy`
metres above it; negative = down to the warehouse floor). Your `geometry()` places each leg's foot at
`-standHeight + dy` for the row covering its station and drops a leg squeezed under ~5 cm. Copy the
consumption from [belt-conveyor/part.js](../examples/parts/belt-conveyor/part.js) (`restDyAt` /
`placeLeg`).

**Spur conveyors** (a splayed bed merging onto a line at an angle) are declared on the length `face` handle:
`{ kind: 'face', axis: 'x', angleFrontParam: 'angleFrontDeg', angleBackParam: 'angleBackDeg', sideGap? }` names
the params that splay each end face (degrees about +Y; centre origin: front face `x = +L/2 + tan(front)·z`). The
host then gives the part the built-in spur's merge behavior: angled snap ends (the splayed face mates flush on a
straight conveyor's side and opens its guard there), a parallelogram footprint and collision hull, and, if the
part declares a `guardExtents` numberList (`[side ±1, backX, frontX]` rows), host-fed rail/guard end overrides
so the frame reaches the host's wall across the junction (render and collision). `sideGap` is the clearance off
the host's bed edge at a side merge; the default (2 × the frame-flange gap) suits both shipped spurs. Override
it only for a bed with hardware past its mated face, and keep it well under the 0.15 m contact tolerance the
opening and extents resolvers use, since a large gap leaves a visible dead strip and brings the merge close to
dropping. Copy the shape from [spur-conveyor/part.js](../examples/parts/spur-conveyor/part.js).

`guardExtents` isn't spur-only. A straight or belt conveyor that declares it gets the same rows when its end
merges flush onto another conveyor's side; there the overrides retract its rails and guards to the host's outer
wall plane (the host's frame never opens), so the frames butt instead of interpenetrating. Copy the consumption
from [belt-conveyor/part.js](../examples/parts/belt-conveyor/part.js) (`sideArcSpan`).

At such a junction, a part that also declares a hidden `guardMitres` numberList (`[x, c, side ±1]` rows) is told
how to cut each guard end that meets the other conveyor's guard: at outward distance `d` from the guard's inner
face, the end at plan-local `x` sits `c·d` further back. Both guards cut on one shared plane, so the corner
closes like a picture frame. It is visual only (colliders keep square ends; cargo meets only the inner faces),
and rows arrive on opening ends and extents ends alike. Its twin `railCuts` (same rows, mover ends only) fits the
frame rails: since the host's frame never opens, a mover's rail is cut to stop against it (the wall on the host
frame's outer face, the top flange a flange width further out), with `c` the slope of that face across the rail
(0 at a square T, where only the flange steps back). Copy the helpers from
[_shared/guardMitre.js](../examples/parts/_shared/guardMitre.js). A rig guard or rail box needs neither: the host
cuts it.

## Behavior: the `ctx` surface

Besides `params` and the required `step(ctx)`, `definePart` declares:

- `joints`, `grippers`, `lamps`, `servos`: typed name lists for `ctx.joints` / `ctx.grips` / `ctx.lamps` /
  `ctx.servos`;
- `interactive: true`: pilot-mode Use → `ctx.used()` (and `useParam`, below);
- `unit`: makes the part a unit load (see Product state in the table);
- optional `init(ctx)` / `dispose(ctx)`.

State a behavior keeps between ticks lives in variables at the top of the script (`let count = 0`), outside
`definePart`. They belong to one placed part: each instance runs the script's top level afresh, so two placed parts
never share one. There is no `ctx.state`.

### The `ctx` members

| Group | API |
|---|---|
| Time + pose | `dt`, `simTime`, `position`, `forward`, `heading()` |
| Motion math (pure) | `approach`, `approachAngle`, `approachVec`, `angleDelta`, `clamp`, `steer` |
| Conveying | `setSurfaceVelocity(v)`, `setArcSurfaceVelocity({ center, omega })`, `setSurfaceSpeed(s \| [s…])` (along each `conveys` link's own +X, re-read every tick for hinged beds; an array runs each deck at its own speed), `conveyorRunning(id)` (is the conveyor a `partRef` param names running?) |
| Articulation | `joints.name = rad\|m` (`setJoint(name, v)` for a computed name like `'h' + i`, which the typed bag refuses), `measured.joints` feedback, `setSubPose` |
| Servos | `servos.name` (a joint the manifest marks `servo`; `servo(name)` for a computed name): `power(on)`, `moveAbsolute(pos, { velocity, accel?, decel?, direction? })`, `moveRelative`, `moveVelocity(v)`, `follow(setpoint)`, `halt`, `stop` / `releaseStop`, `reset`, `home`; reads `position`, `velocity`, `state`, `inPosition`, `error`, `done(id)` / `aborted(id)`. See [Servos](#servos-let-the-host-run-the-motion) |
| Grippers | `grips.name = bool` (`setGrip(name, on)` for a computed name), `measured.grips` (true = actually carrying). If something takes the load out of a closed gripper (the walking pilot, a drag), it drops its whole load, reads false, and stays open until you command it false again |
| Mobility | `drive(forward, turn)` moves the live root; steer closed-loop off `position` / `forward` |
| Sensing | `sense(beam)` → `{ hit, distance, color }` (hits cargo and the walking pilot, whose `color` is a mid grey that reads as no colour), `zone(name, filter?)` → cargo count (never the pilot or a box it carries; `{ part }` counts one product, `{ kind }` one kind), `zoneAge(name, filter?)` → that cargo's summed age (s), `weight(link)` → kg on a `loadCell` link |
| Cargo | `spawn({ part, params, color, mass, offset, marks })` makes a product: the cargo part `part` names, as if placed, with `params` over its own and `marks` the facts it starts with (a label's code, a destination) ([spawner](../examples/parts/box-spawner/behavior.ts)). The other form, `spawn({ kind, size, ... })` (`kind` `'box'`, the default, `'pallet'` or `'tote'`), makes a bare body. At most 8 a tick, the rest dropped. `despawn(zone)`. See cargo conservation below |
| Product state | See below |
| Lamps | `lamps.name = bool` (`setEmissive(name, on)` for a computed name) |
| PLC tags | `readTag` / `writeTag` (BOOL), `readNumber` / `writeNumber` (INT/REAL), `rising` / `falling` edges |
| Ownership | `tagDriven(name)`: is the tag an attached program's output (a controller owns it)? |
| Interaction | `used()`: one-tick pulse on pilot Use |
| Readouts | `report(param, value)`: a param's effective value (the Inspector's live readout; see `setpointFor`); `display(name, value)`: a live caption for a `label` link's `textFrom` |
| Randomness | `rng()`: deterministic, seeded from the instance's params (identical params = identical stream; add a `seed` param to decorrelate) |

**Cargo is conserved.** A source spawns it and a sink despawns it (every despawned item counts as having left
the line). A machine that stores cargo and gives it back holds the real items with grippers, one per storage
position, and never despawns them to spawn stand-ins ([pallet-dispenser](../examples/parts/pallet-dispenser/)).

**Product state** acts on the cargo in a zone, applied after the tick. `mark` acts on every cargo body whose centre
is in the zone. `dress` and `join` act on "the load": the lowest pallet in the zone and everything resting on it
inside its footprint.

- `mark(zone, key, value)` leaves a fact on each of them (`scanned`, `wrapped`), read back by `marked(zone, key)` (a
  count) and by a beam hit's `marks`.
- `markHit(beam, key, value)` leaves the fact on the one body a beam hit this tick instead: the case a labeller's pad
  touched, the item a coder printed on. Put a short beam on the pad's face and only the case against it is marked.
- `dress(zone, { id, material, opacity?, upTo?, web? })` fits a see-through sleeve round the load in one of your
  package's materials (film, straps). `upTo` clips it at a height above your origin, and it only grows;
  `web: { link, offset, height }` draws the sheet paying out from a roll on that link.
- `join(zone)` makes the load one unit load: a single rigid body, every piece still drawn, counted and sensed
  where it stands; a gripper closing on any piece lifts the whole unit.
- **Product attributes**: a param flagged `attribute: true` on a cargo part (or a unit load) is authored and saved
  like any param, starts the run as that mark, is type-checked when a machine marks it, and reads out live in
  the Inspector.
- **Unit loads**: `definePart({ unit: { joinWhen?, dress? } })` makes the part a unit-load product type. Its scene
  children are the load (nothing inferred), it selects as one, and it starts a run joined and dressed as its
  params say ([unit-load](../examples/parts/unit-load/)). With nothing filed under it, a unit load with a
  `courses` param above 0 stacks the standard load itself (a 48 x 40 in pallet under courses of the
  0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 case layer) as real cargo.

### Auto vs hand: gate comms on `tagDriven`, not on the param alone

A device that is both PLC-commanded and hand-operated (a diverter, a blade stop) follows plant-floor
semantics: the tag is in control only while a controller drives it, meaning the tag is a declared output of the
attached, scanning program. The rest of the time (sim stopped, no program, tag not an output) the operator
controls it:

```js
if (ctx.used()) manual = !manual                              // hand toggle (pilot E / editor C)
if (ctx.params.enableComms && ctx.tagDriven(ctx.params.tag))  // auto wins while a program owns the tag…
                                                              // (enableComms: the manifest's `commsParam`)
  manual = ctx.readTag(ctx.params.tag)                        // …by overwriting the latch (bumpless release)
const want = manual
```

Overwriting the latch gives bumpless transfer: a hand press while owned is undone the same tick, and when
ownership releases (program detach) the device holds its last commanded state instead of jumping to a stale
hand latch.

Mark the tag your auto gate reads with **`autoWhenDriven: true`**:

```js
tag: { type: 'tag', dir: 'in', stType: 'BOOL', autoWhenDriven: true, default: '', label: 'Extend tag (true extends the pusher)', group: 'Comms' }
```

That tells the host the tag commands the device. For a part with a `commsParam` and an `autoWhenDriven` tag,
while a program drives it the pilot crosshair prompt reads **"In auto - PLC controlled"** and a C press on the
selection flashes the same hint (the press is still delivered, so your gate still decides). Don't flag tags
the device only publishes (a button's press, a sensor's beam) or reads as an indicator (a button's `lampTag`):
a PLC driving those never takes the device out of hand control. Likewise a spawner whose hand Use is an
independent kill (AND-ed with the tag, not overridden by it) keeps the plain "Use" prompt.

Don't gate on the comms switch alone (`comms ? readTag(tag) : manual`): that locks the device to an undriven
tag, ignoring hand presses and stuck at `false`, whenever no program is scanning. With the `tagDriven` gate, the
stopped-scene preview poses the device from hand presses and an attaching program still takes over instantly.

**The same applies to every boolean command tag**, not just hand-operable devices. A conveyor's or spawner's
`runTag` gated on the tag name stops the part as soon as a tag is typed, until a program attaches, while the
Inspector shows a speed that does nothing. Gate it on `tagDriven` so the authored value applies until a controller
takes over. Two kinds of tag are not command tags and keep a plain truthiness check:

- Setpoints (`speedTag`, a REAL that replaces a param). It is read whenever comms are on, so undriven it reads 0
  and the part sits still. Declare `setpointFor` (below) so the Inspector shows that.
- Publish-only and indicator tags (a button's press tag, a gate's state-out, a `lampTag`). A driven one must
  never flag the device as owned (`e2e/verify-tag-driven-auto.mjs` covers this).

### `useParam`: name the hand state

When the manual latch mirrors a boolean param (the gate's `open`, the blade stop's `active`), declare
`definePart({ interactive: true, useParam: 'open' })`. That names the param as the device's hand state: the state
a run starts from, set in the Inspector. While a program drives the command tag (`autoWhenDriven`), the Inspector
shows that checkbox as the program's live command, read-only and badged, and returns to the authored value on
release (which is accurate again, since release is bumpless).

It must name a `boolean` param your script adopts, and `step()` must `ctx.report` it with the state the device
is actually in (the param is only where it starts): the gate's `ctx.report('open', open)`, where `open` is the
authored value after any hand presses. Both are validated at package build; the report check looks for a literal
`report('open', …)` in your source.

**Use never writes the param.** Use operates a device in every mode, and none of it is an edit (nothing is saved
or undoable, and collab peers don't see it):

- While running, the press goes to `ctx.used()`. It belongs to the run, and Stop resets it.
- While stopped (C in the editor, or E while walking), the press goes to a live instance of your behavior,
  started from the params and stepped every frame. The device stays where a press leaves it (a gate opens and
  stays open; a second press closes it). The Inspector says it is being operated and offers Reset. Play starts
  from the params, and an edit to the part ends it. A spring-return device (a momentary button) comes back on
  its own.

Your script needs nothing extra: each case is `ctx.used()` delivered to your behavior.

### `setpointFor`: say which param an analog setpoint replaces

`speedTag` doesn't gate a conveyor; it substitutes for `speed`. With comms on, the Inspector's `speed` field
would otherwise show a number nothing obeys. Name the param it replaces:

```js
speed:     { type: 'number', default: 1, min: -3, max: 3, step: 0.1, label: 'Speed', unit: 'm/s' },
speedTag:  { type: 'tag', dir: 'in', stType: 'REAL', setpointFor: 'speed', default: '', label: 'Speed tag (m/s)', group: 'Comms' },
```

While the setpoint is in force, that field shows the live commanded value, read-only, badged `plc`, with the
authored value in the hover; the editable field returns on Stop. The authored param is never written.

Rules:

- It must name a declared `'number'` param (validated at package build).
- The setpoint is in the same units as that param. A curved conveyor converts m/s to arc omega after the
  substitution, so its `speedTag` is still m/s.
- It requires a matching `ctx.report` (checked at package build). `report` supplies the number, straight from
  the expression your `step` acted on, in the param's own units:

```js
const s = running ? commanded : 0
ctx.report('speed', s)          // <- what the field shows while the tag owns it
ctx.setSurfaceVelocity({ x: ctx.forward.x * s, y: 0, z: ctx.forward.z * s })
```

`report` shows the effective value, so a `runTag` holding the belt at 0 reads 0 instead of the commanded 2.5, a
snap-reversed curve reads negative, and a ramp or clamp reads where it is.

Whether the tag owns the param follows `autoWhenDriven`, so declare it the way you gate:

| your `step` gate | declare | live field shows |
|---|---|---|
| `comms && tag ? readNumber(tag) : param` | `setpointFor` | the tag value whenever the tag is bound (0 if nothing drives it, and the part reads 0 too) |
| `comms && tagDriven(tag) ? readNumber(tag) : param` | `setpointFor` + `autoWhenDriven` | the tag value only while a program owns it; undriven it falls back to the authored param, like your script |

Boolean command params need nothing extra: `useParam` plus `autoWhenDriven` is enough. Covered by
`e2e/verify-inspector-live-setpoint.mjs`.

### The motion utilities (use these, don't hand-roll)

```js
// slew a turret/heading the short way across the ±π wrap (a plain approach takes the long way):
yaw = ctx.approachAngle(yaw, targetYaw, turnRate * ctx.dt)

// coordinated multi-joint move: all six joints arrive together (no per-axis finish jitter):
cur = ctx.approachVec(cur, POSES[target], speed * ctx.dt)

// mobile base: drive commands that close on a waypoint (turn in place when facing away,
// full speed when aligned, never overshoots). Arrival/choreography stays yours:
const s = ctx.steer({ x: wp[0], z: wp[1] }, { speed: 1.2, turnRate: 1.6 })
ctx.drive(s.forward, s.turn)
if (s.distance < 0.06) nextWaypoint()
```

Also `ctx.angleDelta(from, to)` (wrap-safe signed difference), `ctx.clamp(v, lo, hi)` and `ctx.heading()` (the
part's yaw). The world convention is `atan2(−forward.z, forward.x)`, and a positive turn is to the left,
matching `drive`.

### Servos: let the host run the motion

A joint a real machine drives with a servo motor (a gantry carriage, an indexing table, a lift) should be a
**servo**, not a joint you pose every tick. Mark it in the manifest:

```json
{ "name": "x", "link": "carriage", "type": "prismatic", "axis": [1, 0, 0], "min": -2, "max": 2,
  "servo": { "maxVelocity": 2, "maxAccel": 8 } }
```

and command it from the script. The host runs the profile (acceleration-limited, velocity-capped, never past the
joint's limits) and poses the joint every tick; a write to `ctx.joints.x` is ignored:

```js
definePart({
  servos: ['x'],
  step(ctx) {
    const x = ctx.servos.x
    x.power(ctx.readTag(ctx.params.enableTag))         // a drive starts disabled, like a real one
    if (ctx.rising(ctx.params.goTag)) x.moveAbsolute(ctx.readNumber(ctx.params.targetTag), { velocity: 0.5 })
    ctx.writeNumber(ctx.params.actualTag, x.position)
    ctx.writeTag(ctx.params.inPositionTag, x.inPosition)
  },
})
```

- A servo follows the PLCopen axis state model that PLC motion blocks drive (Disabled, Standstill,
  DiscreteMotion, ContinuousMotion, Stopping, ErrorStop).
- A new command replaces the one before, blending from the current velocity. `done(id)` / `aborted(id)` say how
  a command ended. A command given `buffered: true` waits for the one ahead instead (`queued(id)` reads true
  until its turn), so you can hand a servo a sequence at once.
- Refused commands return a negative code (-1 not powered, -3 a stop is held; the full list is on `Servo` in the
  SDK).
- Joint limits are software limits: a target past one is accepted, and the servo brakes to rest at or short of
  the limit at its `maxDecel` and goes to ErrorStop (`reset()` once still).
- Every move is a trapezoid (constant acceleration, cruise, constant deceleration); see
  [motion-control.md](motion-control.md).
- Units are the joint's own: metres, or radians for a revolute joint.
- A revolute servo with `"modulo": 6.283185307179586` turns without end (a rotary table, a spindle), its position
  wrapping; its `min` / `max` must cover 0 to the modulo.

### The PLC handshake pattern

The six-axis robot, gantry and AGV all use this pattern:

- an INT `command` tag selects what to run (on the six-axis robot, a job by number from its `jobs` table, or a
  waypoint row when it has no jobs);
- a **rising edge** on `execute` starts the move (`ctx.rising` diffs the begin-of-tick snapshot, so an edge
  can't be lost over the async bus);
- `done` reads true while idle;
- device tags (vacuum, forks) drive effectors.

Copy it from [six-axis-robot/part.js](../examples/parts/six-axis-robot/part.js). Parts write PLC inputs
and read PLC outputs; the scene's ST program owns the logic.

Put an effector's pose in the waypoint row, not a second tag, when the row decides it. The AGV's rows are
`[x, z, headingDeg, forkHeight]`, so picking off a 1 m deck and placing on a 1.6 m rack beam are the same command
at different heights, and sending one spot twice at two heights lifts or lowers in place. `done` then covers the
effector: the AGV reports idle only once its tines and wheels have arrived. The device tag then only grabs or
releases. **Latch a gripper on arrival, never on the tag alone** (`if (settled) held = tag`): a grip
captures the load's offset when it closes, so closing mid-stroke carries the load at that gap the whole trip,
and opening mid-stroke drops it in mid-air.

### Which example to copy

| Want | Copy from |
|---|---|
| Conveying (straight / arc / right-angle) | belt-conveyor, curved-conveyor, chain-transfer |
| A bed of hinged sections, pulled into any shape | flex-conveyor (`conveys` links on joints, a `flexPath` handle, side guides as `showParam` links, zero-pressure accumulation: a `beam` per section and `ctx.setSurfaceSpeed([...])` per zone) |
| Splayed merge conveyor (spur handle + guardExtents) | spur-conveyor, spur-roller-conveyor |
| Articulated arm + comms handshake | six-axis-robot, gantry (three coordinated servos, driven by a waypoint row, X/Y/Z position tags, or setpoints streamed every scan) |
| Mobile vehicle (root motion) | agv |
| Sensors (presence / colour / distance) | diffuse-sensor, color-sensor, laser-sensor |
| Safety device: several beams + a PLC-driven indicator | light-curtain (four `beam` links sized by `rangeParam`, one OSSD output, a muting lamp read from a tag. Muting is the safety program's job, not the part's; the demo's `MutingSeq` block is the example) |
| Identify cargo once | barcode-scanner (a scan line across the conveyor reads each case's code off its marks onto a code tag, and `markHit`s the case it read, so a case held under the arch is read once; a one-shot good-read pulse) |
| Cargo lifecycle | box-spawner (the Spawner: a product, released at a steady interval or on each enable, with a cycle of colours and of one attribute's values for a mixed stream), despawner; palletSpawner (not in the catalog, kept for projects that use it); pallet-dispenser (stores real cargo: a gripper per magazine position posed with `setSubPose`, so a dispense releases only the bottom pallet; a zone interlock; a set-down stack gripped where it stands; stock authored through `holds`); stretch-wrapper (`dress` as the carriage climbs, then `join` + `mark`; a carriage eye moving with its link; a start / busy / done handshake) |
| Param-driven structure, arrays | rack, fence, stairs, guardRail, platform |
| Interaction + lamps | push-button, stack-light |
| Simple joint devices | safety-gate, blade-stop, diverter |

## Ground rules

The sandbox enforces the first three. The rest keep a part correct and portable.

- Be deterministic. `Date`, `Math.random`, `fetch` and timers are rejected at load. The same inputs give the same
  sim on every run. A `window`, `document` or `process` you declare yourself (`let window = 0`) is your own variable and is not
  rejected; a variable named `Date`, `fetch` or a timer is.
- Loops are budgeted. One call into your part (a `step`, a `geometry` build, `init`) may run 10 million loop
  iterations; past that it is stopped with an error naming the cause. The limit is counted, not timed, so it
  fails at the same point on every machine.
- What `ctx` hands you is yours. `ctx.sense()` returns a fresh copy each call, and bad commands are ignored (a
  non-finite `setSurfaceVelocity`, a non-positive `spawn` size).
- Command, don't accumulate blindly. Drive joints and velocities every tick from params, tags and `simTime`, and
  use `measured.*` for closed-loop feedback.
- Sense what the real machine senses. A real machine has photo-eyes, encoders, position switches and load cells,
  not a volume that counts boxes. Build it from `beam`s, a conveyor's encoder tag, `measured.joints` and `loadCell`
  links, coordinated in the behavior or the PLC program as on the real machine, and act on the body a sensor sees
  (`markHit`). A `zone` suits what happens to whatever stands in a place: a sink, a wrapper's turntable.
- Parts see only themselves. There is no scene query: facts about other parts arrive as host-computed inputs
  (beams, zones, `rest` params, tag values), which keeps a part portable and the sim's inputs explicit
  ([seam-resolvers](seam-resolvers.md)).
- Geometry functions run at author time: `geometry(g, params, ctx)` runs on load, on param edits and when its
  placement `ctx` changes, never mid-sim. Stay within the vertex budget.
