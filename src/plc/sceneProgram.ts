// A scene program written wholly inside `PROGRAM X … END_PROGRAM` - the form a PLC exports and most ST tutorials teach.
// A PROGRAM type runs as an instance (the default controller makes one per type, named after it), and an instance's
// variables are `<instance>.<variable>` (`Main.Extend`). Our binding rule (plc/plcLink.ts soleInstanceAliases): when
// the controller runs exactly one program instance, its variables are also the bare scene tags (`Extend`), so a part
// wired to either spelling is connected. With two or more PROGRAMs and no code outside them, no bare name is given
// (which program's `Extend` would it be?), and the program still loads, validates and runs while a part wired to
// `Extend` never sees it - which is what the warning below is for.
