// The IEC front end of a scene's controller table (core/controller.ts): the CONFIGURATION a table
// stands for, the source a scene actually runs, and a program's problems kept apart from its table's.
//
// The engine compiles one source string and reads tasks from a CONFIGURATION inside it (checker.ts),
// so a table runs by appending the CONFIGURATION it stands for to the scene's program. That keeps one
// parser, one checker and one set of messages for both spellings of a controller. The downside is that
// a problem with the table surfaces in text nobody wrote, and a problem in the program can spill into
// that text (a missing END_PROGRAM parses straight on into the generated CONFIGURATION). Everything
// below keeps the two apart. A program's error is reported in the program, where the editor can mark
// it. A table's is reported as the table's, never as a line number past the end of the file the
// author is looking at.
//
// Every program has a controller. One with no table of its own runs from the default table: one task at
// its scan time, running the code outside every PROGRAM and each PROGRAM (`defaultController`). That code's
// variables are the controller's tags, so they keep their bare names whichever table runs them, and a
// PROGRAM added beside them renames nothing. A program that is only that code, with no table, is not
// composed at all. As the implicit program on its scan time it runs exactly as the default table would,
// so its own text is what runs.
