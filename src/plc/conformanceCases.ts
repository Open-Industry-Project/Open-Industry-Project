RuSTy (PLC-lang): its FOR lowering plants the user-written bound expression in the loop\'s exit test rather than a temporary, and says so in its own comment. Neither is provably right: IEC constrains FOR to a count "determined in advance", but no edition text reachable from here says WHEN the final-value expression is evaluated, so where to read it is this engine\'s own rule. Two compilers agreeing is weaker evidence than it looks, since both lower FOR to a C/LLVM-style loop where re-reading is the lazy path. The snapshot is kept anyway: it is what makes the iteration count knowable at entry, which is the property FOR exists for (WHILE is the construct for a condition re-tested each pass), and the only runaway guard here is a count rather than a clock (the interpreter faults a loop after 1,000,000 iterations), so a body that grows its own bound would run a million iterations in one scan before that fault stopped it.
