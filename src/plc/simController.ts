// Drives a PlcLink from live scene IO, one call per tick. The only device IO is the device-IO tag bridge:
// custom-part behaviors write program inputs by name (fed in via `setExternalInputs`) and read the program
// outputs the host hands back after each scan. So this folds the external inputs into a frozen process
// image, runs one scan, and exposes %I/%Q for a monitor. It stays decoupled from the sim internals so the
// same controller works whether the logic is a local ST program or (later) a real PLC over WebSocket, and
// whoever hosts it: the sim worker's step loop (sim/plcHost.ts), or a test fake.
