// The AST walker, and `compile`, which builds a checked program on the engine every program runs on.
//
// That engine is the typed one (typed/, scanCodegen.ts; docs/plc-typed-storage.md): the program's variables in one
// typed arena, its bodies turned once into JavaScript. The walker here is its reference and its fallback, permanently: plc/scanEngines.test.ts holds the two together, every variable after every scan, and a program the typed
// engine refuses (or a host that will not evaluate generated code) runs here, ~9x slower. The walker evaluates no code,
// so it runs under a strict CSP, and it keeps the variables as JS values, so that the comparison is
// between two independent implementations of storage, not one layout read twice.
//
// It runs what the checker (checker.ts) hands back, relying on each expression's resolved IEC type for width-correct
// integer wrapping, and re-checks nothing. A program is a set of POUs: user-defined FUNCTION_BLOCKs (stateful
// instances), stateless FUNCTIONs, and the main program. Aggregate data (arrays, structs) is stored as nested JS
// values; access expressions (`p.inner.arr[i]`) chain through `member` (struct field / FB output) and `index` (array
// element, 1+ dimensions).
