// Import: a spec-legal IEC 61131-3 source file becomes a program this engine can run, for someone who
// already has ST (the exporters only write a program out).
//
// Two shapes come in, and they are imported differently.
//
//  - One program (one PROGRAM POU, at most one task, one instance, one resource) is exportText.ts run backwards:
//    importing strips the CONFIGURATION / RESOURCE / TASK / instance layer the exporter synthesises. The POUs
//    and body come in unchanged. The wrapper is recovered (the task period becomes a suggested scan time) or
//    reported (`notes`). The program's variables keep their bare names.
//  - A controller (more than one of any of those) comes in as written: this engine runs a CONFIGURATION's tasks
//    and instances itself, and stripping the layer would drop programs.
//
// Both share the exporter's trivia mask, so a keyword inside a comment cannot be mistaken for the real one.
//
// This is not a vendor-dialect translator. An incomplete address or a construct outside the subset is named in
// `notes` and left to the checker to reject, never silently rewritten: a program that means something other
// than what its author wrote is worse than a refusal.
