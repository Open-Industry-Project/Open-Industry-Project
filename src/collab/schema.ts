/**
 * Yjs document schema for a collaboratively-edited scene, and the pure conversions
 * between it and the editor's `SceneJSON`.
 *
 * Layout (one `Y.Doc` per room):
 *   parts : Y.Map<id, Y.Map>   one Y.Map per part: scalar fields plain, `params` a nested Y.Map,
 *                              so two concurrent edits to the same part (a drag vs an Inspector
 *                              toggle) merge field-by-field instead of clobbering.
 *   order : Y.Array<string>    canonical part order (reorder / move up-down / tree); the standard
 *                              Yjs map-of-data + array-of-keys pattern.
 *   meta  : Y.Map              version (the SceneJSON version) + the shared program's scan time.
 *
 * Position is three keys px/py/pz, not a Y.Array, so concurrent moves land last-writer-wins per
 * axis instead of a torn [newX, oldY, newZ] merge. List/object params (segments, rules,
 * guardOpenings, ...) are JSON-string atoms: the editor always rewrites them as whole arrays, so
 * a per-element CRDT would gain nothing and conflict with that contract.
 *
 * SDK parts (`type: 'part'`) are package-driven, not PART_DEFS-driven:
 *   - `packageId` is the instance's identity; without it a peer materializes a blank placeholder.
 *   - the static spec walk writes nothing for them (`PART_DEFS['part'].params` is empty by
 *     design), so the param bag is carried verbatim. Its values are all Yjs Any, so decoding
 *     doesn't depend on the package being registered yet (a part can arrive before its package).
