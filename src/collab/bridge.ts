 * The local scene as the shared doc should see it while this client runs its own private sim.
 *
 * "Shared design, personal run" (docs/collab.md): each client runs its own sim off the shared
 * scene, so sim runtime must not propagate. Cargo breaks that rule, because handling a live box
 * goes through `store.commit` like any authoring edit. Grabbing a spawner box (click, band-select,
 * pilot pick-up) promotes it into a real part. Dragging a running box commits the pose physics gave
 * it, and injecting or duplicating cargo mid-run adds more. All of it is run-scoped, and the
 * controller drops it on Stop. Without this view the commit reaches the doc first, and a peer who
 * never pressed Play receives our physics state as an authored edit: phantom boxes in their scene,
 * and their boxes moved to wherever our belt carried them.
 *
 * So while running, the doc's cargo pose is frozen. A cargo id the doc already holds keeps the doc's
 * position and rotation (physics owns where a box is mid-run, core/frame CargoPose), and one it
 * doesn't hold never arrives. Everything else still propagates live: a box's settings (size, colour,
 * mass) are authoring, and so is moving a conveyor mid-run. The editor store draws the same line for
 * the solo document (the store's RunOwnership, storeDocument.ts; docs/document-and-run.md).
 *
 * One pose change is authoring: a box carried by an ancestor this change moved (a pallet-load group
 * dragged mid-run). Its doc pose follows the ancestor's rigid motion, so peers see the load move with
 * its group and Stop re-asserts it there. Seeing that takes `prevLocal`, the local scene this change
 * started from; without it nothing is treated as carried.
