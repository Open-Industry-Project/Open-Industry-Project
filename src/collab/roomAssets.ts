// A ROOM's part assets, kept on the collab server by hash (server/assets.mjs; docs/part-sources.md "Rooms").
//
// An embedded asset is written to the room's Yjs document as its hash, `{ ..., room: <sha256> }` in place of
// `data`, and its bytes go to the server's asset store once; a peer fetches each hash once and caches it. As base64
// in the document, every peer would download it with the room, the document would keep it for good, and a script
// edit would re-send the model.
//
// Both directions stay SYNCHRONOUS for the schema (collab/schema.ts), because a package is written inside a scene
// transaction and read by docToScene:
//   - writing: the hash is computed here (cached by the base64 text) and the upload is queued, retried until it
//     lands. A peer that asks before it has landed gets a 404 and tries again.
//   - reading: an entry whose bytes are here becomes `data` again, exactly as it was written (a `sha256` field only
//     if the writer's asset had one), so a package reads back equal on every peer. One whose bytes are not here yet
//     is fetched, and the package is left out until they arrive ({@link onRoomAssetsArrived} says when): the bridge
//     already copes with a part whose package comes later.
//
// Unconfigured (no room, a test, a room opened offline), nothing changes: assets stay embedded both ways.
