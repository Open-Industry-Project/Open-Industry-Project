// What the PLC panel's organizer tree lists, derived from the program's blocks. Kept out of the component so it can be
// tested without one.
//
// The tree is the shape tools built on IEC 61131-3 generally draw: the top-level code, the tasks and the programs they
// run, then the POUs by kind, the data types and the global variables. The words are plain ones (Programs, Function
// Blocks, Data Types) rather than abbreviations, which read as jargon to anyone who did not learn on them. Every entry
// is a view over the program text: the tree holds nothing of its own, so a program edited as text re-derives it.
