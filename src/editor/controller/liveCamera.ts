// Following someone's view (docs/live-share.md "Watching"). While this client follows someone (live/followTarget.ts),
// its camera follows theirs, eased between the poses they publish. Moving one's own camera detaches it
// (`liveViewDetached`), which keeps the run but not the view; the chip's Follow view, a new person followed or a new
// spotlight attach it again. In pilot or VR this client drives its own camera, so nothing is applied then.
//
// A client publishes its camera ten times a second while anyone follows it (presence `view`, collab/session.ts), and
