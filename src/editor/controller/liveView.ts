// Live share on the controller's side (docs/live-share.md): this client's run frames go to the room while it shares,
// and another connection's shared run is drawn while this client runs nothing.
//
// Following draws the shared run's frames, smoothed by core/live/livePlayback.ts. No worker, no program, no part
// code: the store stays stopped, so nothing a run owns (Use, cargo promotion, the PLC panels) is live, and the
// document is never written. `liveFollowing` in the store puts the view alone in its running state (the controller's
// store listener), which is what draws cargo and run poses, and puts the idle poses back when it ends.
