// The demo cell as an acceptance test: the palletizing line run headless for 90 simulated seconds,
// asserting that product actually moves through it. demoScenes.test.ts checks the scene's structure
// (geometry, wiring, what the program compiles to); the demoScenesSim specs check that it works when stepped.
//
// Nothing else measures motion: a Jolt bump, a friction re-tune, or a conveyor-surface change can leave
// every tag correct and every gate green while cases stop feeding, rows stop forming, or the load never
// leaves. The checks below are a ladder (feed → transport → row → layer → putaway), so a failure names
// how far down the line the regression is.
//
// The ladder runs at a spread of the physics step rates a project may choose (whole Hz, 60 to 1000), weighted
// toward the low end, where this cell breaks (low rates can sink a loaded pallet into its deck: docs/sim-clock.md).
// Every choosable rate must run the same cell, program and thresholds; only the I/O latency and the sampling
// resolution change. So a rate that cannot pass this ladder must not be choosable. Each rate is its own spec file,
// demoScenesSim.<rate>hz.test.ts, because vitest runs files in parallel and the tests in one file one after another:
// in one file the four runs were most of the unit suite's wall time.
//
// No JSON is authored here: the scene is built by code, part ids are resolved by package, and the
// zones come from the demo's own exported constants, so a layout re-tune moves the test with it.
//
// **The scan period matters**, and the demo sets it: its controller table runs MainTask every 10 ms
// (demoScenes.DEMO_CONTROLLER, the store's default scan). The runner scans on a stored table's own interval,
// so `scanMs` in the specs has no effect here; it is what a program with no table would get.
// Scanning every 16.7 ms sim step instead breaks the cell's edge-triggered handshakes (the AGVs never move and
// no layer completes), which reads like a physics bug and is not one.

 * 500 Hz 84.5 s on a quiet machine, and past 120 s on a loaded one, so a 120 s limit fails this test. The limit is a
 * hang guard, not a speed check (this test asserts what the cell does), so it carries ~3.5x headroom over the quiet
 * time.
