// A phone that would open on an empty scene opens on the demo instead.
//
// Phones are view/select/run only (App.tsx: no catalog, no transform tools, no tour), so an empty scene there is a
// dead end: nothing to place, nothing to run, and the one useful thing, the example, three taps away in the Project
// menu. The demo boot (`/app/?scene=demo`, main.tsx) is an ephemeral view that saves nothing until an edit forks it,
// so opening it on a phone loses nothing.
//
// Only on a fresh navigation. Every path that deliberately opens a project reloads into it (documentStore
// openDocument / createDocument, sceneFile leaveDemo), so a reload means someone chose what is on screen; bouncing
// them from an empty project they just made or opened back into the demo would undo that choice.
