// The headless project-test runner (docs/project-tests.md): step a scene's physics + its ST program
// forward in simulated time and feed the observed tags to the core evaluator. It lives in the editor
// layer for the same reason controller.ts does - this is the only layer allowed to import both the
// sim (SimWorld) and the PLC engine (LocalPlcLink); core/sim/plc each ban the others. It has no UI
// and no React; the CLI (scripts/test-project.mjs) and tests call it directly.
//
// The PLC↔sim seam is the custom-part tag bus, not the built-in binding adapter (which reads
// render-side sensor beams and is not headless): SimWorld itself casts sensor beams and lets each
// part write its detections/state as tags (world.frame().tags), while PLC outputs + scheduled test
// inputs flow back in via setBehaviorInputTags. That is the same path every first-party part uses -
// the whole catalog is authored on the SDK (docs/architecture.md).
