// Save (Ctrl+S, and the toolbar's Save): one command that behaves the same on every surface. The
// project already saves itself as you go, so Save writes anything still pending and, on the first Save of
// the page, says where the work is. Only that location differs.
//
//   desktop, or a folder synced both ways -> the folder (projectFolderSync; "Saved", or a banner)
//   browser                               -> this browser's storage, with "Download a copy" beside it
//   a live room                           -> the room, which saves for everyone as they work
//
// The app binds Ctrl+S in the browser too, or it reaches the browser's own "Save page as" and saves the
// app's HTML. Save never downloads one scene: that reads as saving the project and is not.
//
// Not "download a file every time": a Downloads folder full of project (3).oip is not a
// save, nothing reopens those, and the work is already stored. The copy is one click away, offered at
// the moment someone is thinking about keeping their work, instead of as a warning on a first visit.
