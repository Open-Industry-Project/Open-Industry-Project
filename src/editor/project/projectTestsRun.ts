// Running a project's own tests in the browser: the in-app half of `npm run test-project`.
//
// The runner itself (projectTestRunner.ts) is portable: core + sim/world + plc, no Node. This module
// lets the app reach it. It is separate from the command because the jolt import must stay dynamic.
// A wasm module in the eager bundle would use up the build's eager-JS budget (scripts/optimize-assets.mjs)
// on a feature most sessions never invoke, so it loads only when someone actually runs the tests.
//
// `jolt-physics/wasm` matches sim/worker.ts's single-thread default, so a test run
// re-uses the .wasm the browser already fetched for the sim instead of pulling the base64-embedded
// 'wasm-compat' build in alongside it.
