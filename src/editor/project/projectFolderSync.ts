// The project folder, kept in sync both ways: the desktop's store of record.
//
// Every edit is written back a moment after it is made, and anything else that changes the folder (an
// agent, an editor, a git checkout) is loaded in. The folder is what git, backups and agents see.
//
// Two hosts, one engine: the desktop (desktopProjectApi.ts) and, once linked or saved to a folder, the
// Chromium browser (projectFolderLink.ts adapts a File System Access handle to the same FolderApi).
//
// The decisions live in core/project/folderSync.ts and are made per file against a baseline (what the folder
// held, and what the app would have written, when the two last agreed):
//   changed only here          -> written to the folder
//   changed only in the folder -> loaded into the app
//   changed in both, differently -> a conflict: nothing moves until the user picks a side (the banner)
// Every write is guarded: the shell replaces a file only if it still holds what this module last read
// (apps/desktop/projectFolderIo.cjs applyFolderWrites), so an agent writing the same file at the same
// moment is never silently overwritten; the next round sees both changes and asks.
//
// The localStorage working copy is untouched and still written on every commit: it is the crash
// buffer, and the boot path still opens from it. This module writes the folder on a short trailing
// delay, and once more, synchronously, as the window goes away.
//
// Timing: the folder's fingerprint is checked once a second (cheap - sizes and dates, no contents);
// the project is serialized only when the fingerprint moved or the app saved something since.
