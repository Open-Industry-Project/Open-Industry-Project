// New project: one door for the projects list's "+ New project", the File > New Project command (Ctrl+N) and

// the others, never the current one emptied: the project being left is saved on the way out and stays in
// the list. On the desktop the new project gets a folder of its own from its first moment.
//
// Either way the editor reloads into it (documentStore.createDocument / desktopProjectBridge
// createFolderDocument), so a successful call does not return to its caller in any useful sense; the
// string it resolves to is the reason nothing happened.
