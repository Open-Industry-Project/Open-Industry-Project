// Make a copy of a live room: the room's document as it is now becomes a new project of your own, in this
// browser's library, and the tab opens it. The room is not touched, and its link still opens it (Back does too).
//
// It is the export-leave-import round trip done as one step, because two steps of that trip fail in a room.
// Importing is refused inside a room. A room whose part code this browser has not allowed exports stand-ins
// for those parts (sceneFile.noticeHeldCodeInExport), and says so only after the file is written. Here the held
// code refuses the copy up front, so a copy is never a project whose parts silently do nothing.
//
// Not a fork that stays linked: no "pull the room's changes", no merge. The copy is an ordinary
// document from the moment it exists.
//
// The sequence is the shelf's New (documentStore.createDocument), with one difference: the working copy in
// localStorage is not the room (a room never autosaves there). It is the solo project this browser had before
// joining. So that is what gets filed as the outgoing document, read fresh from storage, before the copy takes
// its place.
