// The document library: the browser-local store that lets a browser hold more than one project, so
// recents and the project manager have something to list.
//
// The design is a split between two stores:
//
//   localStorage `oip-web/project`  = the working copy of the open document: synchronous write on every
//                                     commit, SaveResult, quota banner (projectFile.saveStoredProject).
//                                     The hot path that holds the user's work.
//   IndexedDB   `oip-web` documents = the library: every document, including the open one's last
//                                     synced snapshot. Written asynchronously, off the edit path.
//
// The localStorage quota is a few MB, and one project with an embedded model can already exhaust it
// (AutosaveBanner). N projects there would multiply that failure, so the library lives in a store
// measured in hundreds of MB.
//
// Switching writes the chosen document into the working copy and reloads, reusing the tested boot path
// (same as .oip import and desktop folder open). Swapping in place does not work: the outgoing library's
// registrations shadow the incoming document's snapshots (projectFile.adoptImportedProject).
//
// The seam is narrow (list / read / write / delete + a current-document pointer), so a folder-backed
// implementation can sit behind the same calls later. This one needs no picker and works in every browser.
