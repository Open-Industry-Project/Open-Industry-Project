// A project of the user's own, shared (docs/live-share.md "Sharing a project"). Sharing is a property of the project,
// not a place the user goes: the project keeps its name and its place in the Projects list, and while it is shared its
// room is where everyone edits it. This browser, which owns the project, takes the room's document back into the
// project as it changes (startWriteBack), so the project never falls behind the room and there is no copy to return to.
// Opening the project again rejoins its room (main.tsx). Stop sharing makes it the user's alone again.
//
// Which projects are shared, and with which room, is this browser's record. Its owner token, registered with the room
// when it is shared (server/roomOwners.mjs), is what lets this browser close the room, so that Stop sharing makes the
// links stop working: the edit secret cannot, since every editor holds it. The token never leaves this browser except to
// the room's server.
