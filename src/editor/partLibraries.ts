// Part libraries, as the editor sees them (docs/part-libraries.md): parts published outside the app, listed in a
// static index, for projects to copy from. The project's library stays the only place its parts come from; a library
// is never read live. core/partLibrary.ts holds the index format and the statuses; this module fetches, checks and
// installs:
//
//   libraryUrls      the index URLs this app reads (partLibraryUrls.ts, kept apart so the Catalog's first frame
//                    asks which libraries exist without loading the rest)
//   readLibrary      fetch and validate one index
//   downloadVersion  fetch one listed .oippart, build it, and check it is the version the index lists
//   installFromLibrary  copy a downloaded part into the project's library, stamped with the version it came from
//
// `/app/` is cross-origin isolated, so a library on another origin must answer with CORS headers, or every fetch here
// fails (and its pictures load as CORS requests, components/CatalogPlaceButton.tsx).
