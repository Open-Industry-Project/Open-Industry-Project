// The desktop app's half of a hand-over (collab/handoff.ts): a browser's Open in Desktop App sent its project, and
// the shell booted this window at `?handoff=<secret>` (apps/desktop/deepLink.cjs). Take the project, ask, and
// import it exactly as File > Import Project would: it opens as a new project, and the one open now is filed under
// Projects first.
//
// The ask is not a formality. The link is web input: any page can fire one, with a document it filled itself, and a
// project carries part code that runs here with the desktop's file and network access. The user is the only one who
// knows whether they just pressed the button, so they are asked before anything is imported.
