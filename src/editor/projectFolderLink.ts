// Linked project folder: the browser half of "a project lives in its folder".
//
// On the desktop every project lives in a folder the Electron shell reads and writes. The browser gets
// the same thing through the File System Access API. The user picks a folder once (Link, or Save to
// Folder), and the page keeps a handle to it. From then on the same engine the desktop runs
// (projectFolderSync.ts) keeps the project and the folder in sync both ways. Edits here are written there
// a moment after they are made, changes made there (an agent, an editor, git) load here, and the same
// file changed in both places is a conflict the user settles. There is no server and no upload: both
// sides read the same directory on the same disk.
//
// This module is the browser host for that engine: the pickers, the permission requests, remembering the
// handle per document (folderHandleStore.ts), and `browserFolderApi`, which adapts a directory handle to
// the engine's FolderApi. That covers reads, the change fingerprint, and guarded writes: a file is replaced
// only if it still holds what the engine last read, so an agent's write arriving at the same moment is
// reported, not overwritten. A read-only link that never wrote back would lose in-app edits on the next
// external change.
//
// Polling, not observing: FileSystemObserver is still unstandardized, so the engine checks a cheap
// fingerprint once a second (sizes and dates; contents only when it moved), bounded to project.json and
// the format's known subdirectories (PROJECT_SUBDIRS).
//
// Chromium only - Safari and Firefox have OPFS (a private sandbox the user never sees) but no picker for
// a real folder, so `supportsFolderLink()` is false there and the commands are greyed out. The desktop
// has its own host (desktopProjectApi.ts), so none of this runs there.

 * link the user dismissed must disappear from the screen at once. Both surfaces come through here (on the desktop the
 * engine's detach also records the choice, so the project is not handed a new folder unasked).
