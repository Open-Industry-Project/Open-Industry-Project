// Splitting an older project: where the other scenes of a multi-scene project go (docs/projects.md).
//
// A project holds one scene since format 4. An older document that held several splits when it is read
// (core/project.ts validateProject): the scene that was active stays the project, and every other scene comes
// back as a project of its own (`splitOff`, named "<project> - <scene>", each with copies of the library parts its
// scene places and the tests that named it; the library stays whole in the kept project). Whoever read the document parks those before anything saves over
// it (projectFile.parkSplitOff: the boot, an import, a library document opened); this module files them, once, at
// the next boot:
//
//   desktop, the project lives in a folder  ask once, listing the folders it will make. Yes: each scene gets a
//                                           folder of its own beside the project's, and the project's folder is
//                                           rewritten in the format-4 layout (its scenes/ files removed - they
//                                           moved). No: the session goes read-only, nothing is written, and the
//                                           next launch asks again.
//   anywhere else                           each becomes a document in the projects list (a desktop one gets its
//                                           folder on its first edit, like any app-only project), and a notice
//                                           names them.
//   a browser with no library               they stay parked (nothing is lost), and the notice offers each as a
//                                           .oip download (file.exportSplitOff).
//
// The folder case has to finish before the folder sync starts (App.tsx waits on it): the sync's first round would
// otherwise remove the moved scenes' files from the project's folder before their own folders exist.
