// The editor's commands: one definition per app-level action, shared by every surface that offers it.
// Separate copies per surface drift apart (a native-menu Cut that stays clickable with nothing selected
// while the tree menu greys it out), so the label, enablement and behaviour are defined once here.
//
// The split of duties:
//   core/keymap.ts  owns chords (portable, no store); a command names one by id via `keys`
//   this module     owns label + enablement + behaviour
//   each surface    renders the list; it decides layout and nothing else
// commands.test.ts checks the join: every `keys` must name a real keymap action.
//
// The context is module-level rather than passed through props (App re-publishes it each render). One editor
// instance owns the window, popped-out panels included (they run in this same module instance), so there is
// nothing to disambiguate, and a menu item three components deep needs no ctx prop.
