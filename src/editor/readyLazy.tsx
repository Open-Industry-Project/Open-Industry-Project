// A lazy component that opens at once when its chunk is already here.
//
// `React.lazy` + `<Suspense fallback={null}>` still delays the first render even when the chunk was fetched ahead
// of the click. A lazy component suspends on its first render whether or not the module is loaded (the import is
// only started by that render, and its promise settles a microtask later), so the boundary commits its fallback.
// React 19 then throttles the reveal that follows a fallback to 300 ms after it (`globalMostRecentFallbackTime + 300`
// in react-dom, to stop spinners flickering). So with plain `lazy` the first opening of every lazy dialog waits
// 300 ms for nothing: measured on three of the PLC panel's dialogs alike, 340 ms to the first field against 45 ms
// for the second opening. Prefetching does not change it.
//
// This keeps the chunk lazy (the eager-JS budget is why these are chunks at all) and drops the suspension. `preload`
// fetches it and keeps the component, and a mount that finds it kept renders it directly: no boundary, no fallback,
// no throttle. A mount that does not find it renders nothing, fetches, and shows it as soon as it arrives, which is
// what `fallback={null}` showed, without the 300 ms after it.
