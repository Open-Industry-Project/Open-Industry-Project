/**
 * Start downloading the loaded scene's part assets as soon as the scene is known, instead of
 * waiting for each part's visual to be built.
 *
 * Asset requests are otherwise emitted by createPartVisual, which cannot run before the renderer
 * exists, and under WebGPU the renderer is built asynchronously (dynamic three.webgpu import +
 * device request), so the scene's geometry and textures would queue behind a GPU handshake they do
 * not need (seconds of idle link on a throttled prod build, ?webgpu&scene=demo). The pill, the cover
 * and the visuals are unchanged; this only moves the byte transfer earlier.
 *
 * A plain `fetch` that warms the HTTP cache, not the typed loaders. meshCache and
 * texCache (parts/sdk/materials.ts) are keyed by URL and the consumer owns the flags. A texture's
 * colorSpace depends on whether the material samples it as BaseColor or as a packed ORM map, which
 * a manifest-level prefetch cannot know. Seeding those caches with guessed flags would cause a
 * wrong-gamma bug. On a slow link bandwidth is the bottleneck, so warming the HTTP cache gives
 * nearly all of the speed-up. The decode still happens once, later, in the consumer with
 * the right flags.
 *
 * Counts through beginAssetLoad, so these are "the user's own assets" for the assets-quiet signal:
 * the speculative catalog sweep yields to them (controller.warmCatalog).
