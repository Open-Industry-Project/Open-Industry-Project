          offers (tabs under their strip). One row: the PLC dock gives this view about

          a chord, and the menu names it. Toggle Bit is the one exception, shown only while the program runs. It wraps,
          never clips, when the panel is narrower.

          A READ-ONLY view drops the bar rather than disabling it, which is the rule the PLC panel's header already

          third of a drawer whose whole job is to show rungs - and not one of them can act; the tabs go with them,
