// Where the program runs: the body of the Controller Properties dialog (ControllerDialog.tsx), opened from the
// organizer's Controller node, the toolbar's link status and the "PLC Controllers…" command. Here in the simulator, or
// on a real PLC that Play hands the scene's I/O to instead (editor/links/externalPlc.ts).
//
// What it carries is not configured here. A part is wired to an I/O point by its PLC tag (`%IX100.0`), and
// the Modbus point follows from the address, so this only lists what the scene makes, before Play as well
// as during it, and says what cannot be carried. What runs the default controller and how Play reaches it are the
// project's (SceneJSON.plcs, an edit with undo); where the PLC is, the simulator's port for a PLC that polls it or the
// PLC's address for one that serves, is this computer's (store/storePlcs.ts). The same fields (PlcLinkFields) set
// each named controller's link in NamedPlcsSection.tsx. Assigning the scene's
// tags their addresses (Assign I/O, the I/O list) is the project's business, not this machine's, so it is a
// command on the organizer's Top-level code row rather than a button here.
