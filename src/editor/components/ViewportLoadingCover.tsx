/**
 * Full-bleed cover over the 3D viewport on first load, lifted once the building has its GLB geometry and
 * textures (whenBuildingReady), so the first building the user sees is the finished, textured one. The
 * toolbar and panels stay interactive underneath; parts keep streaming in behind the "Loading models…" pill.
 *
 * The progress signal is the stage label, and there is no spinner; do not add one. The WebGPU
 * pipeline pre-warm stalls presentation, not just the main thread: no frame is painted for 1.4-2.2 s on a
 * cold pipeline cache (e2e/probes/spinner-hitch.mjs), so a CSS spinner freezes mid-rotation and reads as a
 * hang. A label needs a frame only when it changes; RenderView announces each stage a painted frame ahead
 * (see LoadStage). The post-cover pill (ModelLoadingIndicator) keeps its spinner, since frames present there.
 *
 * Known gap: on WebGL the label sits at "Loading models…" through a ~1.5 s synchronous program link. It
 * fires before whenBuildingReady, so it has no verified point to be announced ahead of.
 *
 * The cover returns for a scene swap that cannot draw in one frame (sceneSwapCover.ts). It appears instantly
 * (`.swap` drops the transition), since a fade-in would show the pop-in it exists to hide, and leaves with
 * the usual fade because the lift removes `.swap` in the same render that adds `.ready`.
