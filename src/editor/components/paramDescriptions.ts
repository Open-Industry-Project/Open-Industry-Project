 * One-line property descriptions shown as inspector hover tooltips, for the rows the host owns.
 *
 * A part's params document themselves - the SDK's `ParamSpec.desc`, authored next to the value it explains
 * and carried through `schemaToParamSpecs` - so nothing here is keyed by part type: every part instance
 * reports `type: 'part'` (the discriminant), so a `${partType}.${paramKey}` table could never match, and a
 * user-authored part could not use one.
 *
 * What is left here is what no package owns:
 *   - the `_`-prefixed built-in rows (`_name` / `_visible` / `_position` / `_rotation`), which the
 *     Inspector renders for every part regardless of type, so they are stored unqualified;
 *   - `building.*`, still a core PartType with static PART_DEFS params rather than a package.
 *
 * Adding a description for a part belongs in that part's `params` block, not here. `paramDescriptions.test.ts`
 * fails if a key in this table names a part type that no longer exists.
