/**
 * Scene annotations, drawn as screen-space chips over the viewport - the icon + caption a person pins to a
 * place to explain the layout.
 *
 * The chip is DOM, not scene geometry, so it stays the same readable size wherever the
 * camera is, faces you from every angle, and can't be walked into. A sign modelled on a wall would have none
 * of those properties, and a note is about the layout rather than part of it.
 *
 * It follows its spot through `view.worldToScreen`, the same projection the tutorial's placement hint uses.
 * Selection goes the other way round from every other part: there is nothing in the 3-D scene to hit, so the
 * chip is the hit target and clicking it selects the annotation - after which the ordinary transform gizmo
 * (attached to the annotation's empty transform) moves it like anything else. That click needs `.note-chip`
 * in the viewport controller's overlay opt-out, or the viewport captures the pointer and eats it.
 *
 * The frame loop reads the scene from the store, not from props: a placement preview and a
 * drag are pushed as transients (store.setTransient), which by design do not re-render the React chrome
 * (the panels would starve the render loop). Reading through props means a note being placed or
 * dragged is invisible until the commit, which is exactly when you need to see where it is going. The loop
 * already runs every frame, so reading the live scene there adds no work and includes the transients.
