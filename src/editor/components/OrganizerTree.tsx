// program's own groups (POUs by kind, data types, global variables), and last the scene's Devices.
//
// This file is the tree and how it behaves: folding, the right-click menus, the name fields, the Tasks section and every
// edit of the controller table (core/controller.ts, through controllerEdits.ts), and the Devices section. What hangs
// in it from the program text - the rows under the Controller node and below Tasks, what a program's row is called and
// its menu, the Properties dialogs - is PlcOrganizer.tsx's, handed in as `OrganizerContent`.
//
// Presentation only: every entry is a view over the program text and the controller table, and every command is one
// of the panel's edits. A delete is not asked about: undo takes it back. The state here is what is folded, which name
// field is open, and which menu or dialog is up - and the last of those is held apart from the tree (Popups), so that
// opening a menu over a tree of hundreds of rows renders the menu, not the rows.
