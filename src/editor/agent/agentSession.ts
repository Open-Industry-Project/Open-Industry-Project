// What a connected agent is doing and has done to the open document, for the person watching (docs/agent-tools.md,
// "Working beside a person"). Two things: the call in flight, so the editor can say an agent is at work, and a review
// of the agent's run of edits. The review opens at the agent's first edit after the person last answered one, with the
// document as it stood before it, so the editor can list what changed and offer Keep or Revert.
//
// Revert walks the undo history back to where the run began, through the same path the History dock's jump uses. It
// does that only while every step above that point is the agent's: a person's edit made in between would go with it.
// A test the agent kept is project structure, not an undo step, so revert does not take it back; the review says so.
//
// Loaded with the tools (desktopAgent.ts), never on the first frame. The diff the review shows is agentReview.ts.
