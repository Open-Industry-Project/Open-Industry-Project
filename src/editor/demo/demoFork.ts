// The demo fork's host: what happens to the user's project when an edit makes the demo theirs.
//
// The demo becomes a project of its own (store.stashDemoSession), so the project it was opened from has to be
// put away untouched: filed in the library under its own id, its folder let go of, and the screen given a new
// document id. The store asks for that through setDemoForkHost and does the rest itself (the new project's one
// scene, the notice); this module is the part that knows about the library and folders, which the store does
// not import.
//
// No reload: the scene on screen is already the new project's, so this is not the in-place project swap the
// reload-based switches exist to avoid (projectFile.adoptImportedProject) - nothing is loaded, and the only
// library change is dropping the outgoing project's custom parts, which the demo does not use.
