// Ready-made scene for the PLC/ST demo: a layer-forming palletizing cell, wired so the paired program drives
// it with no manual setup. Start/Stop latch the line. A spawner feeds cases onto the infeed; a pop-up diverter is
// held extended across the lane as a turning plow, so each case of the turned row catches it on a corner and pivots
// 90° as the rollers keep driving. Cases accumulate nose-to-tail against a blade stop into a row, and a chain
// transfer pushes each finished row aside to make room for the next, pressing it square on a layer stop. Two
// rows - 2 straight cases beside 3 turned ones - make one 1.2 x 1.0 m layer, built right on the forming lane.
// A big six-axis palletizer with a layer-sized vacuum plate then lifts all five cases in one grip and lays them on
// a pallet, spinning the plate 180° on the middle course so the stack interlocks. Three courses fill the pallet;
// the finished load leaves down the line, and an AGV forks it off the staging lane (pallet and stack together),
// carries it to the rack line and puts it away on a shelf, bay by bay, while a pallet spawner drops a fresh empty
// one on the build deck. A three-tier tower shows running / outfeed blocked / E-stop, and the cell's safety gate is a live
// interlock: opening it pauses the robot and the truck and turns the tower red until it is closed again.
//
// The cell is built around one pattern: `LAYER_PATTERN` below is one arrangement, and the whole 3-course load is
// that layer laid at 0°, 180°, 0°. So the line only builds one thing, cases need only one of two orientations, and
// the palletizer needs only two wrist angles. The cell's geometry follows from it too. Every row accumulates against
// the same stop, which puts cases at exactly the x offsets the pattern asks for. Both rows form on one lane, so a
// single 0.5 m push (away from the way the plow deflects) sets their z offsets.
//
// The working cell sits down the centre of a 40 x 30 m warehouse furnished with dressing: a pallet-rack line down
// one side, a pedestrian walkway down the other, a raised viewing gallery over the cell, and painted zones.
//
// Compass: +x is east and +z is south everywhere in this file (the plan view with north up). So the receiving dock
// is the west wall, the shipping dock the east one, the racks stand north of the line and the walkway and gallery
// south of it, and the cell's gate is on its south run (CELL_SOUTH_Z, the larger z). Comments and names both follow
// it: a "north" anything has the smaller z.
//
// Every part in the demo is a bundled SDK part (examples/parts/*) placed as a `custom` instance, so the
// demo runs entirely on parts authored against the public part SDK, wired to the PLC over the device-IO tag bridge. The only built-in types left are the
// pure-container `group` nodes and the warehouse `building` shell, which have no SDK equivalent.

   A1 A2 | curtain along the direction of travel, A1 the outer eye. A load arriving blocks A1, then A2 while A1 is still

   someone close enough behind the load to block an eye before its tail clears the curtain keeps the muting open and
   gets through, which is the limit of any muting by eyes, and why their spacing matters.
   Anything else that breaks the curtain (a person, a box set down in the opening, a load coming the wrong way, which
   meets the curtain before any eye) drops Clear; blocking only the eyes never does. MaxTime ends a muting that lasts
   too long, a load parked in the opening. On a real line this runs in the SAFETY program; its settings and the eyes'
