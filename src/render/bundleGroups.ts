/**
 * WebGPU render bundles, on by default under WebGPU (`?nobundle` turns them off). view.partsGroup and
 * the instance pool's output group become BundleGroups, so the main pass records its commands once and
 * replays them until the structure changes. Encode cost is paid per edit instead of per draw.
 * Gate: e2e/verify-render-bundles.mjs.
 *
 * What animates on replay without a re-record: object matrices and material uniforms, but only via
 * viewport/bundleReplayRefresh.ts's walk on active frames. Stock replay's refresh list is desynced
 * and freezes rig poses (e2e/probes/bundle-rig-freeze.mjs; `?bundlelive` moves movable parts out of
 * the bundles as the internals-independent fallback). `static` is forced false on every group, or
 * three skips even the per-object refresh check.
 *
 * What needs a re-record: anything that changes the draw list (a mesh added/removed/(un)hidden, a
 * geometry or material swap, an InstancedMesh count change). three doesn't detect it. Structural
 * seams call notifyBundleStructureChanged, and view.tick's syncBundleInvalidation polls
 * structureVersion for async stragglers. A missed seam shows as "data changed, pixels didn't"; add
 * the notify. Camera moves don't re-record (see markBundleCameraState; `?nobundlecam` reverts).
 *
 * The groups are created inert (isBundleGroup=false) and activated only around the consolidated
 * outline's main scene pass (including the shadow update inside it). The mask pass and wall/overlay
 * sub-passes share scene + camera + target, so an active bundle there would replay the main pass's
 * draw list instead of their own filtered one.
 *
 * Renders inert everywhere else by construction: WebGL (the ctor is only registered on the
 * WebGPU path), XR, thumbnails, compileAsync.
