  /** per-update refresh (deck rescale); rig is static at rest until applyJoints drives it. Content that
   *  doesn't use an argument ignores it.
   *  - `openings`: the neighbour-derived side-guard gaps the host computed for this part (a butting
   *    conveyor). A belt-like function part cuts them into its guards.
   *  - `grid`: the host-resolved world-phase roller grid (roller beds). A rig folds its `anchor` into the
   *    array-distribution seam so a butted neighbour shares its roller grid, and reads `nudgeLo`/`nudgeHi`
   *    as "this end abuts a collinear roller neighbour", so a part can author end-of-bed geometry that
   *    meets that neighbour (GeometryContext; docs/seam-resolvers.md).
   *  - `extents`: the snap-derived spur end overrides. A spur-view function part extends its rails/guards
   *    out to the host wall it feeds (withSpurExtents).
   *  - `platformCut`: the stair→platform structure cut (railing gap + deck notches), which a rig platform
   *    lays out in place (split rails, skipped + framing posts, deck strips). It uses the same
   *    retained-mesh reconcile as the conveyor guard cut, so a snapped stair sliding along the deck edge
   *    never tears the rig down (a full rebuild per pointer-move lags the snap).
   *  - `legRests`: the host-derived per-leg footing rows for a legged bed crossing a platform
   *    (legRests.ts). A function belt folds them into its params (withLegRests); a rig lays its leg
   *    stations out on them.
   *  - `holes`: the sensor-beam holes through its side guards (guardHoles.ts). A function conveyor folds
   *    them into its `guardHoles` param; a rig splits its guard sheet around each and fills the gap with
   *    a holed panel. */
