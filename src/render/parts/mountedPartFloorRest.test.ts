// Regression: the blade stop, chain transfer and diverter are conveyor-mounted equipment whose rig origin sits
// at the belt/deck surface, so their real geometry (housing, deck, chain lanes - mostly GLB meshes core can't measure)
// hangs well below local y=0. Each committed rig.json bakes that true assembled underside as `bounds.floorY`
// (the build script computes it from the GLB). partFootprint folds floorY into the footprint's `y0` so a
// free-standing floor drop rests the true underside on the floor. With y0=0 the origin sits on the floor and
// the mechanism sinks through it ("blade stop / chain transfer snap below the floor"). A rig that declares no
// floorY keeps a bottom-origin footprint (y0=0), so a floor-standing rig (e.g. the stairs, whose sloped
// stringer corner merely clips below the origin) is never spuriously lifted off the floor.
