 * request would turn the warehouse floor black under a lifted cover, since the gate settles on failure by design. A
 * neutral 2x2 degrades to "untextured but correctly lit".
 *
 * The neutral value is per channel: mid grey for albedo, black for emissive (or the fixture glows)
 * and flat +Z for normals.
 *
 * 2x2, not 1x1: three's WebGPU backend caches a texture's GPU view under a key of its size and mip count
 * (WebGPUBindingUtils.createBindGroup) and never clears that cache when the empty 1x1 default is replaced by
 * the real upload. A 1x1 single-mip fallback gets the default's key, binds the default's view, and samples black
 * for the session whenever the failure lands after the surface first drew (docs/three-coupling.md).
 *
 * Apply it only after the fetch has definitively failed. Never use it as a placeholder before the image
 * arrives: three's WebGPU backend sizes a GPUTexture from the first image uploaded, so a 1x1
 * placeholder would leave the surface permanently sampling 1x1 (gpuTextureAudit.ts audits this class).
