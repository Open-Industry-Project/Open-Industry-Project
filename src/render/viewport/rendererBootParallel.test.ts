/**
 * Canary: createWebGPURenderer must load its thirteen WebGPU-only modules (three/webgpu, the four
 * renderer patches, the outline factory, three/tsl and the node-material factories) in one parallel
 * round. Awaited in sequence, each request waits on the previous response, ~5 s of pure round-trip
 * latency for ~15 KB of code on a real link, with the view mount and the loading cover waiting.
 * Only their install order matters.
 *
 * This is a source-shape test rather than a runtime one because the failure is invisible in every
 * environment a unit test could run in: it only shows up with network latency, and the e2e gate
 * that measures it for real (e2e/verify-first-load.mjs) needs a prod build. A source check runs on
 * every `npm test`, which is where a re-serialisation would actually get caught.
 *
 * If you need a new WebGPU-only chunk: add it to the existing Promise.all and destructure it -
 * don't await it separately.
