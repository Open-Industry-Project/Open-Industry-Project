/**
 * Scene-global InstancedMesh pooling (default-on; ?noinstancepool kills it).
 *
 * Every part builds its static hardware (legs, bolts, axle stubs, structural boxes) as per-part
 * InstancedMeshes, and three (WebGPU) keys a pipeline on the mesh uuid, so N identical banks cost N
 * pipelines and N draws. This manager merges identical hardware into one world-space pool per
 * (geometry-content, material, shadow) signature and hides the originals (tagged `userData.poolHidden`,
 * so the outline mask can tell them from author-hidden meshes). Only parts under a live drag are
 * excluded (see view.poolExempt):
 *   - Selection: a selected part stays pooled and outlines from inside the pool via the per-instance
 *     `aSel` channel.
 *   - A pure-move drag streams poses through writeThrough() (in-place row rewrites). Only structural
 *     drags (resize/scale/guard-opening, a mid-drag param change) eject at pointer-down.
 *   - Picking: Raycaster ignores `visible`, so hidden sources still hit; merged copies are noRaycast.
 *
 * Pool objects are persistent: a fresh `new InstancedMesh` is a cold pipeline (keyed on the uuid)
 * compiled on the draw path the frame after the click, throwing load-time pre-warming away. So each
 * signature keeps one long-lived mesh whose instance buffer + count are rewritten in place. An emptied
 * pool is parked (detached but kept, so drag end reuses it); pools are disposed only when their
 * geometry source leaves the scene or on dispose().
 *
 * The pool also ingests plain meshes tagged `userData.poolUnit` (rig.ts), one instance each, from
 * static rigs: unit-primitive link meshes (size in mesh.scale) and the leaves of GLB mesh links
 * (tagPoolLeaves). "Static" means nothing moves the link at runtime (no joint, aim, or `setSubPose`
 * name, core subPosedLinkNames): the merge bakes world matrices, so a pooled moving link would sit at
 * rest. rig.ts stamps `poolMobile` on every FK-moved link group and collectEligible prunes the subtree,
 * which covers a rig's instanced banks too. Late-arriving children re-pool once their attach burst
 * settles (viewPool.ts poolRebuildOnStructureSettled).
 *
 * Excluded (kept per-part): `userData.dynamicInstances` banks (per-frame instanceMatrix; unit-tested,
 * unused in production), `spinUniform` materials (rollers), transparent or transmissive materials
 * (three sorts those per object, so a merged copy would draw out of order; sortedBlend), meshes with `instanceColor`, anything
 * off the default layer (ghosts on OVERLAY_LAYER), and the subtree of a static-fold root
 * (`userData.staticFoldRoot`, staticFold.ts), which does its own batching. User-hidden parts and the exempt set
 * (view.poolExempt) are skipped wholesale.
