/**
 * WebGPU first-paint: pre-warm the render pipelines before the loading cover lifts so the scene
 * never fades onto a black, still-compiling frame, in two phases that reach an interactive scene
 * ~2-3x sooner than one whole-scene compile:
 *
 *  1. Building first. three's _projectObject skips visible=false subtrees, so hide every non-
 *     building part and compileAsync only the building shell + env: heavy shared pipelines first.
 *  2. Parts. Reveal the parts and compile them. The loop is held (stagedReveal) until they're warm
 *     so no frame draws an un-compiled pipeline, which the render path would compile synchronously
 *     (a hitch).
 *
 * Both phases feed Dawn concurrently (withConcurrentPipelines); that changes when we await, never
 * what compiles. `?serialphase1` restores phase 1's serial feed.
 *
 * Where the cover goes is measured by e2e/probes/compile-phases.mjs, and the phases have opposite
 * shapes: phase 1 is mostly waiting on Dawn for a few heavy building shaders (only fewer or cheaper
 * building materials move it); phase 2 is mostly main-thread codegen per item (only fewer items or
 * less NodeBuilderState work move it). Size codegen savings from e2e/probes/codegen-attribution.mjs,
 * not nodebuilder-census.mjs: most redundancy sits in object-level keys (`object.uuid`, `context.id`)
 * that pipelineDedup.ts collapses, and the per-instance rest is by design (rig.ts mints a material per
 * part; see renderIdentityKey in instancePool.ts). Codegen is paid on every visit, since Dawn's
 * disk cache holds pipelines, not the JS emitting WGSL (e2e/probes/codegen-warm.mjs).
 *
 * Pipeline cost has two regimes (markPipelineTimes): wall time per pipeline with many in flight sizes
 * how long a phase waits; isolated time under `?serialcompile` sizes total compile work. Most pipelines
 * are minted by live draws, not the pre-warm (recordLiveMint: the shadow pass's ShadowMaterial, building
 * materials attaching after projection), but all of them are pool load, so the floor is total pipeline
 * work / pool width: no scheduling change can move it, only fewer or cheaper distinct pipelines.
 * three's per-item `yieldToMain` is cheap with `scheduler.yield()`, a whole frame per item without it
 * (schedulerYield.ts).
 *
 * The cover lifts when both phases have settled (see startStagedPrewarm). A pure optimisation over
 * three's always-correct on-draw compile: if a phase throws or a three upgrade defeats the concurrency,
 * parts compile lazily on first draw - less smooth, never broken. See e2e/webgpu-smoke.mjs
 * (correctness), perf-webgpu-load.mjs + e2e/probes/compile-phases.mjs (timing); ?serialcompile forces
 * the stock one-shot compile, ?serialphase1 only reverts phase 1's feed.
