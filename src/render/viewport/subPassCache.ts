/**
 * Cached projection for the consolidated outline's non-main sub-passes (WebGPU). Default on;
 * `?nopasscache` turns all of it off.
 *
 * These passes (consolidatedOutlineNode: the overlay pass and the selection-mask pass) render with
 * bundles inert, so three's `_projectObject` walks the full scene graph once per pass per frame even
 * when the output is a handful of meshes (the bundle-children skip exists only on the active-bundle
 * replay path). That cost grows with part count while the output doesn't, and a selection adds two
 * more such passes per frame.
 *
 * The output is independent of camera pose: bundled meshes have frustumCulled=false forced
 * (bundleGroups.flushBundleInvalidation), overlay subtrees force it off at creation, the overlay
 * lights are fixed top-level Scene children (env.ts), and `renderList.push` captures the resolved
 * (object, geometry, material, group) tuple. So a projected list changes only when the draw list does
 * (bundleStructureEpoch; (un)hides must notify anyway or the main-pass bundles would be stale), plus the
 * per-pass churn the caller encodes in `sig` (overlay: visible subtree; mask: scene-activity serial).
 *
 * Mechanism: `_renderScene` calls `_projectObject(scene, ...)` once at the top level. Bracketed by the
 * caller's begin/end, the patched version either replays the captured `push`/`pushLight` calls into
 * the empty render list without traversing (hit), or runs the stock traversal while capturing them
 * (miss). A stale sort-depth `z` only affects front-to-back sorting, not correctness; draw-time state is
 * read live, so replayed content still moves. Only list membership is frozen between records.
 *
 * Feature-detects `_projectObject` (r186). If a bump moves it, the brackets no-op and the passes run the
 * stock traversal again: a perf regression, never a rendering bug, so no forced fallback (unlike
 * bundleReplayRefresh). Diagnostics on `globalThis.__oipSubPassCache` ({ records, replays }).
