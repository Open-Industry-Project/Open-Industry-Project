/**
 * Render-bundle replay refresh (default-on; `?nobundlecam` reverts). A render bundle stores commands and
 * resource handles, never uniform bytes, so a camera move can refresh the replayed bundles instead of
 * re-recording them (bundleGroups.ts `markBundleCameraState`). Stock replay leaves the shared uniform
 * groups stale: `Bindings._update` gates them behind a version compare that replay frames don't reliably bump.
 *
 * Record captures the renderObjects actually encoded. Replay refreshes the dirty and camera-sensitive draws
 * (part 1), re-ships the camera into the shared groups (part 2), repairs the camera after a nested shadow
 * render, and re-records instead of replaying a recording three has disposed part of. Each step and the
 * bug it prevents: docs/three-coupling.md, "Render-bundle replay".
 *
 * Feature-detects three 0.186 internals (`_renderBundle`, `_nodes`, `_bundles`, `backend`,
 * `_bindings.has` / `_bindings.deleteForRender`). If a bump moves them it warns and forces the
 * `?bundlelive` split (forceBundleLiveSplit), since stock replay freezes rig poses. Diagnostics on
 * `globalThis.__oipBundleCam`. Canaries: bundleReplayRefresh.test.ts. Gates: e2e/verify-render-bundles.mjs,
 * e2e/verify-bundle-camera-integrity.mjs.
