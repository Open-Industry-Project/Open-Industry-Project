/**
 * Warm the static catalog thumbnails into the browser HTTP cache. The catalog only mounts the active
 * tab's cards, so every other tab's `<img>` otherwise fetches on first click, a visible lag when
 * switching tabs. The whole set is ~80 KB, less than one part model. Call it early (ahead of the
 * heavy GLB prefetch), since thumbnails are the first thing a user browses.
 *
 * There are two url shapes, because a catalog card comes from a built-in PART_DEFS type
 * (`/thumbnails/<type>.webp`) or a custom-part package (`/thumbnails/pkg/<id>.webp`). In practice the
 * package ids are required: the built-ins are authored on the part SDK, so PART_DEFS holds only
 * `building` plus two noCatalog entries, and warming it alone covers one card out of ~31.
 * `prefetch.test.ts` pins the coverage to the real card set, so a change that drops the package
 * thumbnails fails a test.
 *
 * Skipped: `noCatalog` types (no card) and packages carrying an author-supplied `thumbnail` (already a
 * data URL in the bundle). Don't pass ids with no committed file (desktop-folder or in-app authored
 * parts): they 404 here and render offscreen instead (App.tsx).
