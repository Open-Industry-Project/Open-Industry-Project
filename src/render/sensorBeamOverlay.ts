/**
 * Scene-level renderer for every sensor's beam line (the green/red light-barrier cylinder declared
 * by a `beam` rig link, parts/sdk/rig.ts), drawn as one instanced draw from the overlay pass.
 *
 * Why the beams can't live in their rig group: a beam is `depthWrite: false` (it must not occlude the
 * cargo it stops at), so it must be drawn after what it appears in front of. In the rig it would sit
 * in `partsGroup`, a render-bundle root under WebGPU, and bundles execute at the end of the main
 * pass, so the bundled conveyor hardware draws over it and only green stubs in the guards' discard
 * holes show (WebGL and `?nobundle` are fine). Same failure and fix as the flow arrows (flowArrowBank.ts).
 *
 * The beams keep `depthTest: true`: the overlay pass runs over the full depth buffer
 * (consolidatedOutlineNode.renderLayeredScene), so solid guard metal still hides them and the discard hole still shows them. depthTest-off
 * would float every beam over its own guard.
 *
 * Why instanced: outside the bundles the beams are encoded fresh every frame. Per-beam meshes cost a draw +
 * pipeline each, and every show/hide changes the overlay projection-cache signature
 * (consolidatedOutlineNode.overlayVisSig). One InstancedMesh with the tint on `instanceColor` is one draw
 * at any sensor count. It is not a bundle: instances re-aim every probe, so it would re-record continuously.
 *
 * Ownership: rig.ts's probeTick writes each beam's world aim + tint every probe (a beam inherits
 * nothing from its part), and view.tick calls {@link syncSensorBeams} once a frame to
 * resolve visibility and rewrite the instance buffers.
