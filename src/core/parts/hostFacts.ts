// The facts the host hands a drawn part through its params.
//
// A part never sees the scene, so the host works out what its surroundings mean for it (a neighbour's end butting a
// guard, a sensor beam crossing one, the wall of the conveyor it merges onto) and passes each fact in as a hidden
// numberList param of a fixed name, which the part's geometry() reads. The sim builds a drawn part's colliders from
// the same params, so the fact reaches the collision as well as the mesh. A part takes a fact by declaring its param.
//
// One that leaves a param out loads and runs, and that fact never reaches it: no error, just a guard that stays shut
// where a diverter's arms cross it, or a beam that passes through solid steel. hostFactWarnings names each fact a
// part's own declarations say it needs and does not take (check-part prints them). A warning, never a refusal: a
// part may mean to leave one out.
//
// A rig part takes none of these: the host cuts and fits its guard and rail links itself.
