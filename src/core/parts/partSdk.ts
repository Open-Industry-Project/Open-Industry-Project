// The Part SDK level: which version of what a part can say this build understands.
//
// The package format (PACKAGE_FORMAT) changes only when a stored spelling has to be translated. Most SDK growth is
// additive (a new ctx member, a new manifest field) and needs no format bump, so an older build loads a part that
// uses it and then fails inside the part, with no word why. The level closes that gap. Every part is stamped with the
// level of the build that last changed it, and a build older than the stamp warns (Problems dock, group Parts)
// instead of failing silently. It warns and never refuses: most parts made under a newer level use nothing new, and
// an installed app updates itself, so the cost of a cautious stamp is one warning.
//
// Raise PART_SDK_LEVEL when the SDK's surface changes. `npm run build-part-sdk -- --check` fails until it is raised
// (packages/part-sdk/levels.json records the surface each level shipped).
