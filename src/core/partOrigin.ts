// Where a project's part came from (docs/part-sources.md).
//
// A project holds its own copy of each part it uses. The copy records, per source it came from, the fingerprint of
// the version that source had then (`PartPackage.origin`): `app` for one of the app's built-ins, `shelf` for the
// parts shelf. Comparing that record with the project's copy and the source's current version says, without any
// history, which side changed:
//
//   project copy vs record | source vs record | status
//   same                   | same             | upToDate
//   same                   | changed          | updateAvailable   (the source has a newer version)
//   changed                | same             | editedHere        (this project changed it)
//   changed                | changed          | changedInBoth     (updating replaces this project's edits: ask)
//
// Keyed by source because one copy can have two: a project's version of a built-in that is also on the shelf was
// made from a built-in and copied from the shelf, and each says something different. A later source (a part library)
// is a new key, not a new field.
