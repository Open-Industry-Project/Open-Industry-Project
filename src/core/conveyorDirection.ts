// The only place the engine folds a conveyor's snap-owned `reverse` flag into its authored `speed`.
//
// A curve can't be rotated 180° to turn its flow around, because that would swap its inner/outer radius.
// So the snap flips a hidden `reverse` flag instead when it mates two ends that both discharge into (or both
// feed from) the junction. Reversing by hand is a negative `speed`. `reverse` is engine storage the Inspector
// never shows (ParamSpec.hidden), so snapping a curve never rewrites the number the user typed.
//
// Which params those are is declared (partPackage.ts ConveyorDecl `speedParam` / `reverseParam`; package format 3
// read params named `speed` / `reverse`). Every engine-side consumer of a conveyor's direction goes through here:
// the flow arrow, the snap's output-end rule, the pilot's surface mirror, the render scroll. The part's own
// `step()` folds the same two fields itself (it runs sandboxed and can't import core), so keep the two in sync:
// effective speed is always `speed × (reverse ? −1 : 1)`.
