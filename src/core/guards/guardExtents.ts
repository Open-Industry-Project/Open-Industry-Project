 * neighbour's end butts its side, this remaps the butting mover's own frame rails and side guards to the host's

 *
 * - A spur stops a sideGap short of the bed edge, so its rails extend to the wall plane and reach the conveyor
 *   it feeds.
 * - A straight roller or belt side-merges with its end face on the wall plane (snapFeatures seats a square T
 *   there). One butted on the bed edge instead (an older scene) overshoots by the wall thickness and retracts.
 *   Otherwise its wall/flange would pierce the host's frame at the mouth corners. A straight only retracts: a
 *   gapped one never grows.
 *
 * The host's frame never opens. Its side channel runs unbroken through the junction, as on a real line; only
 * its guards open.
 *
 * Each value is a mover-local centreline X overriding that side's leading end (facing the host). Transient,
 * never serialised; the renderer remaps the rail/guard meshes and the sim the guard colliders.
