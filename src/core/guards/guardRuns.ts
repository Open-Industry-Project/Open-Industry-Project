/**
 * Guard-run merging: the side-guard counterpart of the butted-belt deck merge (deckClusters.ts).
 *
 * A side guard is built as one collider per part per side. Two conveyors butted end-to-end therefore present
 * cargo with two separate guard bodies meeting at the seam, and Jolt's enhanced internal edge removal does not
 * span separate bodies (the same limitation deckClusters.ts works around; see the GHOST_* notes in
 * sim/world.ts). Cargo squared against the wall by roller skew rides the upstream guard, then hits the
 * downstream guard's leading edge and is kicked ~35 mm off the wall. It recovers only if something keeps pressing
 * the cargo back, so a skewed -> skewed seam hides it and a skewed -> straight seam leaves it permanent.
 *
 * So there is no seam: collinear, coplanar, equal-cross-section guard spans that touch end-to-end are emitted
 * as one longer box by a single owner part (lowest id, deterministic, the cluster-owner pattern deckClusters.ts
 * uses), and suppressed on every other member.
 *
 * Why span overrides rather than world geometry: this resolver returns spans in each part's own local
 * centreline X, the frame `openings` and `extents` already use. The builder computes the box pose, orientation,
 * incline tilt and cross-section the same way for merged and unmerged guards and only takes a different span
 * list. Nothing about guard placement is recomputed here, so a merged guard cannot drift from an unmerged one.
 * Both sides call the same keptSegments(), so the split logic has exactly one implementation.
