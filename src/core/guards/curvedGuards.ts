/**
 * The single enumeration of a curved conveyor's side-guard collision boxes: the arc chord walls plus the straight
 * tangent lead-in/out stubs. Shared by the sim's builder (world.ts addCustomCurvedGuards) and the cross-part
 * merge resolver (guardRuns.ts), exactly like beltGuardWalls and functionStaticWalls: the merge is keyed by
 * wall, so both sides must walk the same list in the same order.
 *
 * Only the stubs are straight, so only they can ever be collinear with a butted neighbour. The arc chords
 * turn, and `sameWall`'s parallel test rejects them without needing a special case. Without curves as a wall
 * source, a skew-driven box riding the guard off a straight into a curve is knocked 32.9 mm inward at the
 * feeder-guard/stub butt, against 0.00 mm for the same feeder with no curve attached.
 *
 * Guard face radius: placement is by face, not centre. A rail's face belongs just outside the belt edge
 * (bed edge ± FRAME_WALL_THICKNESS), where this part's own visual guard is drawn. The outer arc chords also
 * divide out chord inscription (an inscribed chord is tightest at its midpoint), while the straight stubs
 * do not, since a straight segment has none.
