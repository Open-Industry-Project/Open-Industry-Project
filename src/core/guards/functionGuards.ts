/**
 * The single enumeration of the coarse static-box colliders a `function`-geometry SDK part contributes: the
 * `collision: 'box'` submesh channel (spur conveyors, plain straight SDK conveyors). Shared by the sim's
 * builder (world.ts addFunctionStaticColliders) and the cross-part merge resolver (guardRuns.ts), for the same
 * reason beltGuardWalls is: the merge is keyed by wall, so both sides must walk the same list in the same
 * order or a merge decision is applied to the wrong box.
 *
 * A spur's side guards are authored as one `collision:'box'` MeshPart per side (so the AABB is a thin side
 * wall rather than a hull across the whole bed), and its cross-section matches the rig roller's guard exactly
 * (same 0.305 height at the same 0.1475 centre, same 0.005 thickness), so a spur butted collinear with a
 * roller forms a mergeable wall. Without this, a skew-driven box riding the guard is knocked 14.6 mm off it
 * at the seam, against 0.00 mm for a roller->roller butt (merged) and 0.00 mm for the roller alone.
 */

/**
 * The sibling channel, for solids an AABB would misrepresent: `collision: 'hull'` submeshes, enumerated as
 * part-local convex-hull point sets ({@link functionStaticHulls}). Hulls never take part in the guard merge
 * (they are shapes, not walls), so only the sim reads them, and the wall enumeration above is untouched.
