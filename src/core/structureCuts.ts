/**
 * Pure geometry transform: rewrite a rig's link list so a snapped staircase's structure-connection edits show up
 * (docs/part-snap-stairs.md). Both the renderer (rebuild the visual from the cut links) and the sim (build
 * colliders from the cut links) use it, so render and collision can never drift. The transient connection data is
 * computed once in structureConnections.ts; this applies it, opt-in per part:
 *
 *  - Platform: split each opened edge's railing rails/toe/wall boxes into the solid segments left by the gap
 *    (keptSegments), and drop the perimeter posts standing in the gap; carve the deck into the complement
 *    rectangles around each notch. Uncut edges + all other links pass through untouched (so they keep tracking
 *    their size/offset params on the normal refresh path).
 *  - Staircase: lift the whole flight so its top plane sits flush on the deck and the handrail runs on into the
 *    platform railing (applyStairLift). The floor-anchored (`anchor: 'floor'`) links stretch back down to stay on the
 *    floor, and the `dropWhenMounted` ones (its own top landing, which the deck replaces) are left out.
 *
 * Both transforms are keyed on declarative link markers, never link names: a deck part tags each perimeter
 * railing link with `onEdge: 'posX'|'negX'|'posZ'|'negZ'` (the deck edge it runs on) and its walking
 * surface `notchable`; a lifted guest tags its floor-seated links `anchor: 'floor'`, and where it meets the
 * deck comes from its own `snap.edgeMount` declaration (docs/part-snap-cuts.md). An untagged link always passes through untouched, so the
 * transform is a no-op on parts that don't opt in.
