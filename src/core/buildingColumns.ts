// Interior columns: the building's column grid, computed in one place for every consumer.
//
// A real warehouse over ~30-40 m does not clear-span: the roof sits on a grid of interior steel columns, and
// conveyor routes, spurs and rack aisles are laid out around that grid. The building's `columnSpacing` param
// turns one on. Physics (sim/buildingColliders.ts buildingBoxes), the drawn columns (render/parts/building.ts) and the
// layout check (checkLayout.ts) all read the stations from here, so the collider, the drawn column and the
// check-layout warning cannot drift apart.
//
// The grid sits on the building's 10 m section lines (the same grid the wall, roof and floor modules tile),
// every `columnSpacing` sections, with any remainder split between the two end bays so the grid sits centred.
// A column stands at every crossing of an X line and a Z line; a direction whose span is clear (fewer
// sections than the spacing) has no lines, and so the building has no interior columns at all.
