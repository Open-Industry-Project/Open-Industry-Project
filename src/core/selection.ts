/**
 * Selection policy: which ids a gesture's raw hits actually select. The viewport reports what it
 * caught in pixels (a click's pick, a band's rect sweep); this decides what that means against the
 * scene tree, so the rule lives in one tested place instead of inside the pointer plumbing.
 *
 * The only rule is the grouped-subtree redirect: a hit inside a grouped subtree selects the
 * group's root, so the group selects and moves as one (see {@link groupRoot}). The Scene tree
 * bypasses this - a tree row selects exactly the part it names.

 * in first-caught order. `current` is the selection to extend (a shift-band adds to it); omit it for
 * a plain band, which replaces the selection outright.
 *
 * Because a hit only ever arrives from a part the band actually caught, a group is selected exactly
 * when the band caught one of its members. A geometry-less container is never caught on its own -
 * see `view.partsInRect`, which skips zero-extent footprints.

 * sitting diagonally on screen (e.g. a long conveyor) has a bounding box whose empty corners extend
 * well past its real silhouette, so a band drawn over nearby floor falls in one of those corners and
 * wrongly selects it. This does a separating-axis test between the points' convex hull and the
