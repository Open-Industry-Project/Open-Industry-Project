 * all-or-nothing, so under streamed motion (a drag) every frame re-runs whichever ones are
 * wired up. Computing the other side's fields costs render ~20 ms per frame at 240 parts.
 *
 * If a consumer starts reading a field it doesn't get here, add it to that consumer's branch in
 * resolveScene and to its *ResolvedKey. Don't just widen this test.
