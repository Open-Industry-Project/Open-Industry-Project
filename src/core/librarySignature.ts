// The project's signature on a part library's index (docs/part-libraries.md, "Publisher identity"). One key, the
// project's, signs every index the project publishes: its own libraries and the listed library built from the parts
// repository. The index names each part file by its SHA-256, and a part file holds its models and textures, so the
// signature covers every byte a listed part brings.
//
// What is signed is the index without its `signature` field, in canonical JSON (keys sorted, no spaces), so the
// signature does not depend on how the file was formatted. Ed25519, verified with Web Crypto (browsers, the worker,
// node). The public keys are part of the build (librarySigningKeys.ts); the private key exists only in CI secrets.
