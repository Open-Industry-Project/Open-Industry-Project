// Two-way sync between the open project and its folder on disk: the pure decision half.
//
// On the desktop a project is a folder (docs/projects.md "The folder is the project (two-way sync)"), which
// an agent, an editor or a `git checkout` can change underneath the app. This module decides, file by file, which
// way each change flows; it owns no I/O or timers (the engine is editor/project/projectFolderSync.ts).
//
// The rule, per file, against a baseline of the last time the two agreed:
//
//   changed only in the app        -> write it to the folder
//   changed only on disk           -> load it into the app
//   changed in both, differently   -> a conflict; nothing moves until the user picks a side
//   changed in both, identically   -> already agreed
//
// There are two baselines: what the disk held and what the app rendered. The app's rendering is not
// always byte-identical to what it loaded (filled defaults, a refreshed part snapshot, an agent's own JSON style).
// With one baseline that difference reads as an edit, so opening an agent-written folder would rewrite its files
// and every later sync would look like a conflict. A file is "changed in the app" only when the app's own
// rendering moved.
//
// Baselines are hashes: every question is "same as before?", and a manifest can be megabytes (base64 models).
