// at 3.1 s, the eye saw a box at 3.0 s. An agent debugging a program cannot look at a running scene, but the run is
// deterministic, so it can be handed the run itself: every tag's value at the start of a window and each change
// inside it. That is small where a sample-per-step dump is not (an encoder changes every step, a stop button once).
