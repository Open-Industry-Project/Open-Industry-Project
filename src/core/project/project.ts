// A *project* is one machine (a layout and the program that runs it) plus what belongs to it: its own part
// library and its tests (see docs/projects.md). The portable artifact stays one JSON
// document, so it keeps the share/collab/archive properties of a scene file: the web serializes it to a single
// `.oip` file; the native shell spills the same document into a folder (core/project/projectFolder.ts).
//
// Format 4 holds one scene. Formats 1-3 held several, each with its own program, that never ran or referred
// across each other; such a document still reads: its active scene becomes the project, and every other scene
// comes back as a project of its own in `splitOff`, for the host to file (docs/projects.md "Splitting an older
// project").
//
// This module is the pure data model + (de)serializer only. It reuses scene.ts's per-part and per-package
// validation wholesale, so it inherits every clamp/migration scene validation does.
