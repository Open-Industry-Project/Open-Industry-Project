/**
 * The i18n seam: every user-facing string in the app resolves through one function.
 *
 * It ships no translations: one locale ('en'), `t()` returns the source string, no pixel changes. What it adds is
 * the split between prose and identifiers, which no automatic translator can make.
 *
 * /app/ opts out of browser translation (`translate="no"`, app/index.html) for two reasons that outlive any
 * improvement in translation quality:
 *
 * 1. **Prose vs identity.** Page translation walks the DOM, which doesn't record that "Belt Conveyor" is a label
 *    while `Conv1_Run` is an identifier an ST program matches by exact string. Translate that and the program
 *    loses its tag. The information is in the code, so the split belongs here.
 * 2. **It white-screens React.** Chrome rewraps translated text nodes in <font>, React 19 updates a node whose
 *    parent moved, and the app crashes. `translate="no"` on identity spans fixes (1), not (2).
 *
 * The desktop shell's menubar is native (apps/desktop/main.cjs), with no DOM to translate at all.
 *
 * Browsers are taking over producing translations (Chrome's on-device Translator API), not extraction (knowing
 * which strings are prose). So this module owns extraction and holds no translations: `setLocale()` accepts a
 * dictionary from anywhere, including an on-device translator fed by `messageCatalog()`.
 *
 * Shape notes:
 * - `t()` is synchronous, over an already-resolved dictionary; async work happens once in `setLocale()` at boot.
 * - Resolution order is active locale → source → the id itself. A missing translation degrades to
 *   English, never to a blank or a crash.
 * - Headless and DOM-free, like the rest of core.
