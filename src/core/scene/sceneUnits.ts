// --- the scene's Units: one choice for how the scene is shown and what its conveyors' speed tags carry ---
//
// A plant uses one convention: its drawings, its conveyor spec sheets and its program all use feet per minute or
// metres per second, never both. So the scene holds one setting (SceneJSON.units, Scene Properties) that decides
// two things. First, the unit every length and speed field shows and takes (core/units.ts, display only; the
// document stays SI). Second, each conveyor's units switch (the SDK's `imperialUnits` boolean: its speed and speed
// tag in FPM, or in m/s; the tag is a REAL either way). The switch is still a param, because the part's step()
// reads it, but no one sets it by hand. The Inspector hides it, and changing the scene's Units rewrites it on every
// part, with the values it selects.
