// The scene's controllers (SceneJSON.plcs): every PLC the project's tags reach, saved with the project so it travels
// to another computer and through a shared room, and so a rename or a removal is an edit that undoes.
//
// The first is the default controller: a tag with no controller name in front belongs to it (core/io/controllerTag.ts).
// Every other one is named by its tags (`Cell2::%IX0.0`). Each runs in the simulator or on a PLC outside it. In the
// simulator a controller runs the program instances the task table gives it (core/controller.ts ControllerProgram.plc),
// so a whole line of several PLCs can be built and tested here before one of them is real.
//
// Where each PLC is (an IP address, a port, a slot) is not here. That belongs to the bench, so each computer keeps it
// (editor/store/storePlcs.ts). This is the model IEC 61131-3 describes as a configuration holding several resources,
// each a controller of its own.
