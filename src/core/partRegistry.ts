// part's packageId → its geometry/behavior/param-schema, so the catalog, inspector, sim builder and
// render factory all stay schema-driven against whatever packages are currently loaded.
//
// This is process-global module state (like a singleton): a scene's embedded packages are registered on
// load, and the desktop authoring loop re-registers a package on every file save (then re-applies it to
// live instances - see onPackagesChanged in src/editor/controller.ts). Subscribers are notified so the UI/sim
