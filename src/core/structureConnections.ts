/**
 * Geometry-derived structure connections between a part that meets a deck edge and the deck's host (the
 * platform's connection/stair-connection detection, opened to any part: docs/part-snap-cuts.md). When a guest's
 * edge-mount contact is on a platform's deck edge (snapFeatures, `edgeMount`), each effect the guest declares
 * happens:
 *
 *  1. `opens` - a gap in the host's links that run on that edge (`onEdge`) over the guest's width, so a flight
 *     is walkable onto the deck. Ranges per edge, centred on the edge's run axis.
 *  2. `notch` - a rectangular cut in the deck where the guest's footprint (origin → contact) overlaps the deck
 *     interior (the deck hole). Edge-flush seats (the contact on the edge, the part outside) only nick the
 *     rim, so there is no notch. A notch is cut when a flight is placed over the deck.
 *  3. `lift` - the guest itself, once its contact is on the edge, lifts its whole rig so the contact sits
 *     flush with the deck top and the handrail runs continuous into the platform railing. Lifting only the
 *     landing would leave a jog in the rail at the top post. `anchor: 'floor'` links stretch back down so the foot
 *     stays on the floor. The lift (deckTop − contact height) is the map value.
 *
 * All transient (never serialised); recomputed every render/sim sync, mirroring the conveyor guard-merge
 * (guardOpenings.ts). A platform is any part advertising a `deck` snap surface with a heightParam (its
 * length/width/height params give the deck). A guest is any part whose `edgeMount` declares one of the effects
 * (its contact point and `alongParam` width give where and how wide). See docs/part-snap-cuts.md.
