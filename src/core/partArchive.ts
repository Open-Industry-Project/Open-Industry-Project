// The .oippart archive: one part's folder, zipped, as a .oip is a project's (core/projectArchive.ts). Unzipped it is
// exactly the folder a project's parts/<slug>/, the shelf and Import Parts from Folder hold:
//
//   manifest.json            the package manifest (baked fields dropped: the behavior re-derives them)
//   behavior.js              the behavior, verbatim
//   assets/<sha256>.<ext>    its embedded assets as files (core/partAssets.ts)
//
// Its own extension, not .oip, so the file says what it is before it is opened: an Import dialog, a file manager and a
// file association can tell a part from a project, the way .dotx and .docx share a container but not an extension.
// The older single-part file, `.part.json` (manifest + behaviorSource in one JSON text, editor/partFile.ts), still
// imports. The two are told apart by their first bytes.
//
// Pure, like the project codec: building a package from the folder runs the behavior, which core does not do, so
// reading stops at the folder's two texts (assets joined back into the manifest) and the host bakes them.
