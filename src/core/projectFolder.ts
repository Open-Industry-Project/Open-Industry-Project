// The project folder codec: the on-disk, git/VS Code/agent-editable form of a ProjectJSON
// (docs/projects.md "The project folder"). One canonical layout (format 7):
//
//   project.json                  thin manifest: name + file refs + the program's small settings (no content)
//   scene.json                    the project's SceneJSON (its parts)
//   plc/<Name>.st | .ld           its PLC program as plain text, one file per POU, in the order the manifest's
//                                 `program` lists them (plc/programFiles.ts names them; `.ld` holds ladder)
//   parts/<id>/manifest.json      each authored library part, in the same two-file layout the desktop
//   parts/<id>/behavior.js        parts workspace reads (manifest sans baked fields + the raw script)
//   parts/<id>/assets/<sha256>.*  the part's embedded assets as files named by their hash (core/partAssets.ts, project
//                                 format 6); joined back into base64 `data` before baking
//   AGENTS.md                     generated context for an AI agent editing this folder (core/agentGuide.ts).
//                                 Unreferenced by the manifest, so it is inert.
//   tests/<name>.test.json        each project test (docs/project-tests.md), one spec per file so they diff
//                                 individually; the path shape scripts/test-project.mjs globs
//
// A part folder is exactly the parts-workspace format (apps/desktop/partsWorkspace.cjs): a real behavior .js, and a
// manifest without the behavior-baked fields (`params`, `format`, `interactive`, `snap`;
// core/partPackage.manifestOfPackage), so the script is the source of truth. Reassembly therefore needs baking
// (running the behavior), which core must not do, so hosts inject a {@link PartBaker} (sim/validatePart, which also
// surfaces script errors).
//
// Pure (files are data: {path, contents}) and shared by the Electron shell (apps/desktop/projectFolderIo.cjs does
// the fs I/O, and the CLIs read through it), the browser and tests. Reassembly funnels through validateProject, so an
// edited folder gets every clamp/migration a .oip does. Loading is manifest-driven: unreferenced files are ignored.
//
// A folder from formats 4-6 keeps the whole program in one `program.st` (the manifest's `stProgram`). It still reads,
// and the folder sync rewrites it in this layout on its first round (core/folderSync.ts `programLayoutBaseline`).
//
// A pre-format-4 folder lists scenes (scenes/<id>.scene.json + scenes/<id>.st). It still reads: validateProject
// splits it, the other scenes returned in `splitOff` for folders of their own (editor/folderSplit.ts); saving writes
// the format-4 layout and the folder sync removes the old scenes/ files. A folder from when projects kept saved
// assemblies (`assemblies/<id>.assembly.json`, retired) reads the same way: validateProject reports them left out,
// and the next save removes the files.
