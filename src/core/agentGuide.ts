// AGENTS.md - the context file a project folder carries for an AI agent editing it.
//
// The folder is the interface between an agent and this app: the agent writes files, the app follows the
// folder and grades the result. But a folder of scene JSON, ST text and test specs says nothing about the
// vocabulary behind it: which tags this scene wires, which way each one flows, what the ST subset allows,
// what a test spec looks like. Without it an agent guesses at every name it writes. This renders that
// vocabulary, derived from the document being saved, so it can never describe a different project.
//
// Derived, not transcribed, wherever it can be: the tag table, the part inventory and the placeable
// package list are read off the scenes' embedded packages, so they cannot drift from the document.
// The prose that remains (conventions, the ST pointer, the test schema) is the part a human must keep
// true, and it is kept short for that reason.
//
// Pure and core-safe: string building over plain data, no DOM/three/React/Jolt and no host imports,
// so the browser save, the Electron save and the .oip zip all emit the same file from one call site
// in projectFolder.ts.
//
// Written at the folder root, where the loader ignores it. Reassembly is manifest-driven
// (folderFilesToProject) and the live sweep reads only project.json plus the format's own subfolders
// (editor/project/projectFolderLink.ts), so this file has no effect on the app and cannot corrupt a round trip.
