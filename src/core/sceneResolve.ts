/**
 * One per-part bundle of every host-computed, neighbour-derived input a part's geometry consumes at scene-edit
 * time (docs/seam-resolvers.md). The roller-grid / guard-opening / spur-extent /
 * deck-cluster / stair-cut inputs share one struct + one change-signature, so render (viewSync.ts →
 * PartVisual.update) and sim (world.ts → buildPart) each pass one value instead of N. Adding another
 * neighbour-effect means adding a field, a resolver and a key contribution. Passing each effect separately takes
 * edits in five files, and missing one leaves a fully-implemented effect wired to nothing.
 *
 * Fields are optional and consumer-specific. Render reads grid/openings/extents/structConn; sim reads
 * openings/extents/cluster/structConn (it has no roller-grid seam, and render has no deck-merge). The two
 * `*ResolvedKey` helpers below select exactly the fields each consumer rebuilds on, so sharing one struct
 * doesn't widen either side's rebuild triggers. `structConn` is the whole scene map (structureCutGeo/Key slice
 * it by part id); it's attached only to the parts a cut actually touches.
