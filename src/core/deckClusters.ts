/**
 * Deck-merge clustering: conveyors butted end-to-end should have their running
 * surfaces built as one physics body so Jolt's enhanced internal edge removal
 * spans the seam (cargo flagged with edge removal never sees the seam as a real
 * lip, so it can't pop/snag crossing it, just as run<->bend seams within a
 * single belt ride flat). Edge removal does not cross separate bodies, so
 * without merging the seam between two parts produces ghost collisions.
 *
 * This finds the connected components of belt-like conveyors whose ends coincide and face into each other (a
 * collinear end-to-end butt - not a perpendicular T, which is a side merge handled by guard openings). The sim
 * builds one merged deck per multi-member cluster; lone conveyors are unaffected. Spurs/turntables/chain
 * transfers are excluded - they don't form end-to-end flow seams.
