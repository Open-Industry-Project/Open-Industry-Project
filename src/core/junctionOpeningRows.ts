/**
 * The openings a conveyor's neighbours cut in its guards (a spur's mouth, a side-merged straight), in the same
 * tail-relative row space its authored `guardOpenings` rows use. Guard-openings mode reads them so the gaps the
 * scene already made are not offered as solid guard: no hover ghost there, and no sweep that would author a row
 * on top of a cut that exists anyway (and outlives the neighbour that made it).
 *
 * deriveGuardOpenings returns neighbour cuts and, on a rig host, its own authored rows folded in. The host is
 * passed with no rows so only the neighbours' remain. Its ranges are in the host's centreline X: a belt maps plan X
 * to arc length through its path, a straight bed shifts its centre origin onto the tail.
