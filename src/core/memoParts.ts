/**
 * Memoize a scene-wide derivation (parts → neighbour-relation map) on the reference identity
 * of the parts that can affect its output.
 *
 * A drag replaces only the moved part objects, so every untouched part keeps its identity: comparing the
 * participants' refs to the previous call is an exact change signal. A non-participant drag (a box through a
 * conveyor field) reuses the map; any participant edit swaps a ref (or the subset length) and recomputes. Scene
 * load, undo and collab present fresh objects, so the gate fails open to a recompute, never stale.
 *
 * Invariants this relies on (enforced, not assumed):
 * - Parts are immutable snapshots; the store deep-freezes scene parts in dev so an in-place mutation throws at
 *   its own call site instead of serving stale derivations (store.setState).
 * - `participates` must cover every part `compute` reads (the *.test.ts equivalence suites lock this).
 * - Output may also depend on the participants' packages, which change under identical refs (author-mode edit,
 *   hot reload): the cache keys on {@link registryRevision} for that.
 *
 * The returned map is shared across frames: callers must treat it as immutable.

/**
 * Like {@link memoizeByParticipants}, but memoized per target instead of all-or-nothing.
 *
 * The whole-scene memo re-runs the entire resolver when one part moves. That is fine for a discrete edit, but under
 * streamed motion (a gizmo drag, a peer's drag, an Inspector scrub) the cost then scales with scene size.
 *
 * Each target caches its exact input set (its own ref plus the refs of the influencers the broad phase handed it)
 * and re-derives only when those differ. A dependency cannot be missed: anything `derive` may read is in the key.
 *
 * The broad phase is incremental too ({@link createFootprintIndex}): buckets persist, only changed refs re-bucket,
 * and each cell carries a version. A target whose cells kept their versions is reused without gathering at all.
 *
 * Net: one O(n) classification pass plus O(cells touched) per target. Measured on `computeSceneOpenings` with one
 * part moving: flat ~0.4-0.6 ms per call from 60 to 480 parts, against 2.6 -> 17.8 ms without this caching.
 *
 * The returned map is rebuilt per call, but the values are shared across frames: treat as immutable.
