// Part libraries: parts published outside the app, for projects to copy from (docs/part-libraries.md).
//
// A library is a static index (JSON) beside the part files it lists, each a `.oippart` (core/partArchive.ts) under a
// URL that never changes. A project's library stays the only place its parts come from: installing copies the part in,
// stamped with the fingerprint of the version it came from (`PartPackage.origin.library`), and updates are explicit.
// The statuses are core/partOrigin.ts's, read here from the fingerprints the index lists, so a listing can say what
// each part is to the project before anything is downloaded.
//
// An index is untrusted input until validated: every file it names is a path relative to the index, so a library can
// only send the app to its own host, and a downloaded file is checked against the index's hash and fingerprint
// before it is used. An index the project publishes carries the project's signature (core/librarySignature.ts), which
// is what makes it the project's, wherever it is served from.
