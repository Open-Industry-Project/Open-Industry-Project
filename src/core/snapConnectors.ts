/**
 * The connector model: what a part's `snap` declaration means to the snap engine (docs/part-snap-connectors.md).
 *
 * Every snap kind a part can declare compiles into connectors, and the engine only works with those:
 *
 * - a plug is a mover-side feature: it seeks a socket of a kind (or, for a peer plug, a same-group plug on the
 *   other part) and knows how to seat against it;
 * - a socket is a host-side feature a plug seats on. Sockets are resolved from the host at solve time
 *   (snapFeatures.ts), because most of them are implicit (every part's footprint faces, every conveyor's guard
 *   rails, ends and roller bed). The rest are declared (`surfaces`, and the peer `tile` / `chain`).
 *
 * The engine pairs each plug of the mover with each compatible socket of a target and solves the pair by its
 * (plug shape, socket shape), using the MATES table in snapFeatures.ts. It keeps the best candidate by one rule: a
 * body-overlap snap outranks a non-overlap one, then the lower cost. The same rule ranks one target against
 * another, so a part that declares several kinds uses whichever fits the drop best, never whichever it
 * declared first.
 *
 * This module is pure declaration-to-data (no geometry, no registry): `plugsOf` compiles a SnapSpec once and
 * caches it on the spec object, which the registry keeps for the life of the package.
