/**
 * Horizontal (world XZ) surface velocity a conveyor imparts at the world point
 * (x, z), or null if the part is not a conveyor or is stopped. This mirrors the
 * surface velocities baked into the sim bodies in sim/world.ts, so a body the
 * pilot stands on is carried exactly like cargo resting on the same surface.
 *
 * The sim is the source of truth for *cargo*; replicating it here is what lets
 * the raycast-based pilot (render/pilot.ts) ride a conveyor the way a character
 * controller rides a static body with a constant surface velocity.
 *
 * Each bed kind mirrors the field its behavior drives in the sim (setSurfaceVelocity /
 * setArcSurfaceVelocity); conveyorBeds.ts has the per-kind field:
 *   - STRAIGHT, SPUR and BELT (`path`): a constant forward carry along the part's +X × `speed`.
 *   - CURVED (`arc`): rigid rotation about the arc centre (the part origin),
 *     omega = speed / centreline-radius - the position-dependent tangent field
 *     v = omega × (p − centre), so the pilot is carried around the sweep.
 *   - ROTATING DECK (turntable): the settled carry along the deck's resting angle. The transient
 *     slew field isn't mirrored (the pilot rarely stands on a mid-slew platter).
 *
 * As with the sim mirror, this reads the `speed` param directly and ignores comms /
 * interlock gating - a placed-and-running approximation, same fidelity as cargo at rest.

 *   - STRAIGHT and SPUR: flat bed at the origin height, tilted about the centre origin by the rig
