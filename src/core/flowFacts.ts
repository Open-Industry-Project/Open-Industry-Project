// Flow facts: what physically happened to the cargo on a running line, reported as facts, never verdicts.
//
// An agent or an engineer building a line loses most of its time on physical problems nothing reports: a box falls
// off a belt, a pusher tips a box that is coasting to a stop, a tumbling box flickers a photo eye into a second edge
// (which slips a tracking queue), a box sits still while the belt under it runs. The tracker watches every step and
// says so, with the time, the place and the part. It never judges: an accumulating line holds boxes still on purpose,
// and that is still reported, as a fact, for whoever reads the run to weigh.
//
// Pure and deterministic: fed one step at a time from the same rows the frame carries (ids, poses, sizes, kinds), the
// sensor beams' raw hits, the parts' tag writes and the live conveyor speeds. The sim runs it after every step
// (sim/flowFacts.ts); the headless runner and check-flow read what it collected (docs/project-tests.md "Flow facts").
