// Static idle actuation preview: the stopped-sim twin of the running frame's per-tick joint output.
//
// While the sim runs, a device's motion lives in its behavior `step()` and reaches the rig via the sim
// frame (world.ts → applyBoxFrame). While stopped there is no frame, so without this a placed device (blade
// stop, safety gate, diverter) would sit at its zero rest pose and look identical however it's configured,
// and you could not see it actuate to check placement without pressing Play. This settles a throwaway behavior
// instance to the steady pose it would hold for the authored params, so the editor can render that pose
// statically at rest (see EditorController.refreshIdlePoses).
//
// It runs the real behavior on the main thread, deterministic and instance-isolated (partScript gives
// each create() a fresh closure), so it can't disturb the sim worker's own instances (a separate realm)
// and only ever runs while stopped (the two are mutually exclusive in time). Neutral input: no Use/click,
// no PLC tags. The preview reflects the authored params (e.g. the blade stop's `active` toggle), not any
// live signal a stopped scene can't provide. The one scene input it can get is `zones`: the authored cargo in
// each detection zone (core/zoneCounts), which the editor passes for a part that stores cargo (PartPackage.holds),
// so a machine whose state is what it holds (a pallet dispenser's magazine) previews holding it.
