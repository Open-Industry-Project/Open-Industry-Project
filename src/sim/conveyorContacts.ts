// Ghost (internal-edge) collision filtering. Each conveyor's running surface is many separate static convex
// bodies (run boxes, bend prisms, curve chord boxes), so as cargo slides across a seam Jolt reports a spurious
// contact with the next facet's leading edge that snags/lifts the box. Our chord facets produce ghosts a single
// trimesh would not, so there are two complementary gates:
//
//   1. Speculative gate - the box has not reached the facet yet (penetration well below zero) and the contact
//      faces sideways-ish. Catches chord-facet / straight->curve speculative ghosts (aggressive at 0.98 because
//      those normals tilt only slightly off vertical).
//   2. Shallow-ram gate - a shallow contact (<= the 2 mm depth threshold) whose normal faces clearly sideways
//      (<= cos 45deg): the *positive-penetration* leading-edge ram between two separate conveyor bodies (belts
//      butted end-to-end, where enhanced internal-edge removal does not apply), which would pop cargo upward onto
//      the downstream belt.
//
// Real support survives both: top support faces up; steep-incline support (up to BELT_MAX_TILT_DEG) faces
// sideways but settles deeper than the slop, clearing the 2 mm gate, as does a real wall.
//
// A conveying rig's 'frame' links (side rails at/under the deck plane) opt into the same gates: cargo sits a hair
// sunk into the deck, so a box pushed sideways off the bed (a diverter onto a takeaway) rams the rail's near-flush
// top edge and pops. buildRigBodies registers them in `conveyors` with an empty entry list (plain collision, no
// surface velocity), which admits them here. Guard links stay unfiltered: a guard stops cargo, and junction
// crossings open them for real (rigGuardSide).

// Coupled planar friction (forked Jolt, ContactSettings::mFrictionCoupling; see the fork's

// Cargo stalled against an obstruction has already used its traction being dragged forward, so it
// should barely resist yaw. That lets a box whose corner catches a hard edge pivot off it and carry
// on down the line. Stock Jolt clamps the two budgets independently, so a stalled box resists yaw
// exactly as hard as a parked one and stops dead. It can also never pivot for any box
// geometry, because the catch's couple is bounded by (drive force x half width) while the torsional
// limit uses the footprint's corner radius, which is always larger. Applied to driven deck facets
// only; guards, frame rails and every non-conveyor contact in the scene are untouched.

// a surface's edge (normal well off vertical) stops being driven; too loose and the flank conveys again.

// edge at a junction). A wall shares their signature (horizontal normal, shallow penetration),
// and lift alone cannot tell the two apart. Without this, a registered body's flank is gated away,
// and a conveying deck would have to be a slab nested inside a plain housing.
