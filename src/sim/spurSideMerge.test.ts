/**
 * The spur side merge, for both shipped spur families.
 *
 * A spur parks `sideGap` off the host's bed edge and its rails/guards then extend back to the host wall.
 * That gap comes out of the same 0.15 budget the opening/extent resolvers gate contact on, so an
 * oversized one is doubly bad: it leaves a visible dead strip between the two beds, and it leaves the merge a
 * nudge away from silently losing the host guard opening and the rail extents together.
 *
 * The roller spur takes the same default flange gap as the belt spur; an oversized one (0.12, for an
 * "end pulley" it does not have) leaves 3 cm of slack, and a lightly nudged spur loses both. These are
 * absolute assertions on the parked distance, not deltas: a uniform drift of every spur would be invisible
 * to a delta test.
