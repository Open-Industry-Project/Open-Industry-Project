// Worker-side PLC host: owns the compiled ST program while a scene runs and interleaves its
// fixed-period scans between the physics steps, entirely inside the sim worker. Each step the
// loop calls interleave() before world.step(): the scan reads the tags behaviors wrote on the
// previous step (%I), runs however many whole scan periods one step of sim time covers, and
// applies its outputs (%Q) so the very next step's behaviors read them. That is the same
// lockstep the headless project-test runner uses (editor/project/projectTestRunner.ts), so the live sim
// and the test harness share one interleave semantics.
//
// The scan accumulator is driven from the fixed step dt (sim time), not wall clock. So the scan/step
// interleave is exactly reproducible, immune to render frame rate, main-thread jank, and tab throttling,
// and a timeScale change scales PLC time with physics automatically (more steps per real second →
// proportionally more scans). A main-thread driver would sample inputs at whatever cadence rAF managed;
// this samples at the sim's own rate, the true information rate of the world. See src/plc/DEVICE-IO.md.
