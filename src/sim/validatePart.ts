// One structured entry that validates a custom part end-to-end and returns located, typed diagnostics
// instead of throwing on the first failure. It is the machine-readable verify half of the authoring loop:
// an author's IDE, the import flow and an AI codegen tool all want "give me every problem with this part,
// with kinds and line numbers", not a single thrown string. buildPackage is the throwing wrapper over it,
// so the build path and the validator can never drift.
//
// It folds together the four failure classes a part can have:
//   - determinism  : nondeterministic / sandbox-escaping primitives (core/determinism.ts) - located
//   - load         : doesn't call definePart, or is a syntax/eval error (embeddedBehavior.create)
//   - rig          : a declared joint/gripper that isn't in the manifest's rig geometry
//   - package      : structural problems in the resulting PartPackage (core/parts/partValidate.ts validatePartPackage)
