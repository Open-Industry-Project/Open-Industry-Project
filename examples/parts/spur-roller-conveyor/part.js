// Spur Roller Conveyor — a splayed merge roller bed (geometry-function tier). Its deck is a
// parallelogram of spinning rollers clipped to independent front/back splay faces, framed by straight L-rails +
// side guards + a trestle leg. The steel is emitted as instanced templates (MeshPart.instances) sharing the unit
// templates (and pool buckets) the straight belt and belt spur use; only the two collision guard walls stay
// per-part meshes. The behavior is a straight roller conveyor's: step(ctx) drives the surface velocity along the
// flow axis (+X) at the set speed and the host both carries cargo on the flat deck and spins each roller about its
// own axle. A negative speed reverses; a PLC comms trio gates/commands it. The rollers are clipped to the front/back
// splay faces, each end roller shortened to the bevel (the per-instance roller `length`). Centred on the origin so the
// host's flat conveying deck (length×width) lines up under the rollers.
//
// This is the part's source. `npm run build-parts` writes behavior.ts (this script as the app ships it, with the
// _shared/ modules it imports joined in and `manifest` left out) and rig.json (the manifest).
