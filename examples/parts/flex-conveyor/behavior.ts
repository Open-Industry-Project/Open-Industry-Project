// Flex Conveyor — an expandable powered roller conveyor: 16 sections on a scissor truss, hinged end to end.
//
// Its shape is a smooth path from the infeed (heading +X) through the control points in 'points', the sections
// fitted along it with equal chords; every hinge is posed from that fit each tick, and ctx.setSurfaceSpeed runs each
// section's deck along its own direction, so product follows every bend. flexStations below MIRRORS
// core/flexPath.ts line for line (a part cannot import core); src/sim/flexConveyor.test.ts holds them together.
//
// It is built the way the real one is - the kind a dock reaches into a trailer with and people pull into whatever
// shape the floor needs: a chain of SECTIONS, each a short roller bed on a scissor-frame truss with a caster leg under
// its hinge, and every hinge free to angle on its own. The bed LENGTH is the fitted chord x the section count, a
// hidden param the editor writes as the points are dragged (the `flexPath` handle): it is what sizes each section, so
// it is the accordion, stretched or compressed. Each section's deck is its own conveying link riding its hinge.
//
// This is the part's source. `npm run build-parts` writes behavior.ts (this script as the app ships it, with the
// _shared/ modules it imports joined in and `manifest` / `rig()` left out) and rig.json (the manifest, with the
// rig compiled from rig()).

// Part frame: the origin is the INFEED end of the conveying surface, on its centreline (y = 0 is the roller tops).
