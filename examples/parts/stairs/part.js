// Stairs — an industrial access flight. Demonstrates array links + parametric geometry + a
// constant-slope rotation: 'numSteps' closed-riser steps rise up-and-forward by a constant rise/run (a
// diagonal array `step`), carried by two sloped side stringers, with a full stair rail — sloped top, hand & mid rails,
// a bottom newel and posts about every metre and a half — that showHandrails toggles off. Invisible guard colliders line
// both open sides (slope + landing) so a walker can't step off. Two-tone: tread-plate treads/risers you
// walk on (the treads collide), steel structure tinted by `color`. Purely structural — the params reshape the
// rig, the step does nothing.
//
// geometry() details it as the steel stair it is (tread-plate treads, closed risers): a steel nosing angle
// along every tread's front edge, whatever the handrail setting; and, with the handrails, the intermediate posts
// (below), two bolt heads on each stringer where every tread is clipped to it, and each post bolted through
// the stringer. Nothing on the top landing: a deck connection drops the landing (dropWhenMounted), which geometry()
// can't see, so hardware there would float. Everything rides the 'railFrame' link, so a snapped stair's
// lift carries it with the flight. No floor anchors: the foot links stretch down to the floor under that lift
// (anchor: 'floor'), which geometry() can't see, so a plate at the foot would float. Render-only.
//
// The flight, as the rig lays it out:
//   - standard 0.178 rise / 0.28 tread → the run/rise follow a `numSteps` count (array `step` is a constant
//     diagonal) rather than independent length/height params. The slope is therefore a fixed angle
//     atan2(rise, run), so the stringers + rails are a static-quat rotation whose length (and centre) track
//     numSteps linearly - the one shape a param-driven angle couldn't express.
//   - two-tone: treads/risers/landing are steel tread plate (finish:'tread' → the rig DeckSurface),
//     the steel structure (stringers/posts/rails/newel) tints with `color`.
//   - top landing: a fixed-depth flat plate + its flat handrail continuation, for a freestanding flight. Snapped
//     to a platform, the flight's TOP meets the deck edge and the deck is the landing: every landing link is
//     `dropWhenMounted`, the deck connection lifts the flight flush, and the sloped rails end on the posts the
//     platform frames its railing gap with.
