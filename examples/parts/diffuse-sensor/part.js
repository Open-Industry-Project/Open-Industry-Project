// Photo Eye - a photoelectric presence sensor, diffuse or retro-reflective (the package id still says diffuse:
// stored scenes and rooms name it). Demonstrates sensing (ctx.sense), an emissive detection LED (ctx.lamps), and
// a PLC presence tag. The lens emits a beam along local +Z; the host casts it against cargo each tick and
// hands back the nearest hit. Both modes come down to that one cast: the first target in the beam before Max range.
//
// The housing is the shared photoeye (_shared/sensorPhotoeye.js), drawn by geometry().
//
// This is the part's source. `npm run build-parts` writes behavior.ts (this script as the app ships it, with the
// _shared/ modules it imports joined in and `manifest` / `rig()` left out) and rig.json (the manifest, with the
// rig compiled from rig()).
