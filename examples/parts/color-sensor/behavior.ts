// Color Sensor — a photoeye that classifies the colour of cargo crossing its beam. Demonstrates the colour
// output of sensing: the host hands ctx.sense().color the detected tint; the behavior reduces it to a colour
// code an ST program reads as an INT (1=red, 2=green, 3=blue, 0=none/ambiguous).
//
// It shares the Photo Eye's housing (_shared/sensorPhotoeye.js), in its own colours (teal body, red lens).
//
// This is the part's source. `npm run build-parts` writes behavior.ts (this script as the app ships it, with the
// _shared/ modules it imports joined in and `manifest` / `rig()` left out) and rig.json (the manifest, with the
// rig compiled from rig()).

// The photoeye's MOUNTING BRACKET, which bolts it to a conveyor's SIDE FRAME - with a guard or without one, and
// touching neither anywhere but where it is bolted.
//
// The guard mount seats the eye with its origin 20 mm below the deck and its lens face 20 mm out from the bed edge,
// over the frame's L-rail (examples/parts/belt-conveyor's rail template; the roller bed's is the same): a WALL whose
// face is 10 mm out from the bed edge, running down from 5 mm under the deck, a 5 mm top LIP reaching out to 30 mm at
// deck height, and - where the bed has one - a GUARD sheet standing on the rail 10..15 mm out (GUARD_THICKNESS).
// Measured outward from the bed edge (u, which is FRONT + 0.02 - z in part-local z), the bracket is:
//   - a SIDE PLATE on the housing's +X flank, bolted through its two holes. Its profile steps round the steel: from
//     the housing down to 3 mm over the lip it stays out past u 23 mm (clear of a guard's 15), past the lip it stays
//     out past the lip's 30 mm tip, and only well under the lip - below the axle heads studding the wall just under
//     it - does it step in to the wall;
//   - a TOE there, square across the beam, flat on the wall face (u 10..13 mm) and bolted to it.
// A floor stand bolts to the toe's face the same way (src/editor/demoScenes.ts EYE_STAND_*), so its numbers are
// transcribed there.
//
// A STOPGAP, and a deliberate copy: the rail's numbers above belong to the conveyor, and are repeated here only
// because a host cannot yet say what steel it offers. Retire this (and EYE_STAND_*) when conveyors publish their
// rail profile on their snap surface and the SDK's bracket helper draws from the seat a mount stores.
