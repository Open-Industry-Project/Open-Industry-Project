// What every conveyor part says to a PLC beyond run / speed / running, written once for the belt, roller, curved,
// curved roller, spur and spur roller conveyors. The speed unit itself is conveyorUnits.js.
//
// THE DRIVE A PLANT PROGRAM TALKS TO. A real line's program writes a speed reference in FEET PER MINUTE,
// reads the drive's output back as a frequency, and counts encoder pulses to track a package. So, beyond the
// speed unit (conveyorUnits.js):
//
//   speedAt30 (Fpm) the belt speed the drive gives at 30 revolutions: the scale of the velocity feedback.
//   velocityTag     REAL out: effective speed / speed-at-30 * 30. A belt running at the speed it is rated for at
//                   30 reads 30; stopped it reads 0; half speed, 15.
//   pulseTag        BOOL out: TRUE for ONE simulation step each time the surface has travelled `inchesPerPulse`.
//                   It can only be as fine as a step: at 60 steps a second a belt at 2 m/s covers 1.3 in a step,
//                   so a pulse an inch needs the project's `simHz` raised (240 resolves it), and a program that
//                   is to see every pulse has to scan at least that often.
//   encoderTag      REAL out: the odometer of surface travel in metres, integrated on sim time in the worker, so it
//                   cannot drift against the physics as scan-clock dead reckoning does. Latch it at a photo-eye,
//                   act once it has advanced a known distance.
//   accelTime /     THE RAMP: a VFD motor ramps, at a rate set as the time from stopped to rated speed (the speed
//   decelTime       that reads 30), and everything above that reads the surface follows it. Defaults are a guess
//                   at the equipment, not a measurement; 0 steps instantly. At Play a PLC-commanded conveyor starts
//                   from rest; one on its authored speed is already running. Every later change ramps.
//
// The drive feedback sits in a `<group>/Feedback` sub-section the Inspector starts folded: it is what a plant
// program reads back, not what most scenes need to set.
