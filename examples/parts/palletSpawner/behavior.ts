// Not offered in the catalog any more: the Spawner (examples/parts/box-spawner) with Product: Pallet and Release: On
// each enable does what this does (core/builtInVersion.ts UNLISTED_BUILT_INS). Kept so a project that uses it runs.
//
// Pallet Spawner — a magazine that emits pallets, or another product. Demonstrates ctx.spawn by product: a rate timer
// emits the product every 60/palletsPerMinute seconds via ctx.spawn({ part, params }); the host creates that part's
// body at the part's pose, as if placed. A Pallet takes the size, colour and mass set here. A pilot "Use" toggles the line on/off (a runtime latch, so it resets on
// stop/reload); pallets drop at the exact spawn point (no positional scatter). Optionally gated by a conveyor
// interlock (conveyorId → ctx.conveyorRunning) or a PLC run tag.
//
// A magazine is COMMANDED rather than paced, so the gate RE-ARMS it: every time it is enabled the next pallet
// drops on that first eligible tick and the rate only paces it while it stays enabled. That is what makes the
// usual wiring - a controller pulsing the run tag for less than one period per pallet change - dispense exactly
// one pallet, every time. Carry the countdown across the hold instead and only the FIRST pulse ever dispenses
// (the timer happens to start at zero); each later pulse just takes its own length off a period that never
// reaches zero, so the line silently runs on with no pallet under it.

let countdown = 0 // seconds until the next spawn
let armed = false // drop on the first eligible tick after each enable, not a period later
let usedOff = false
let spawned = 0

// Publish what this feed has dispensed, every tick (a display not republished goes blank): the infeed half
// of the line's numbers, which a despawner's count is the other half of - the two differ by the work in
// progress. It counts REQUESTS: past the physics engine's 10,240-body table a spawn is skipped, uncounted
// by the host but still counted here.
