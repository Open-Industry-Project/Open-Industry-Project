// Spur Belt Conveyor — a splayed merge belt (geometry-function tier). Its deck is a
// parallelogram (the splayed ends let it merge flush onto a main line at an angle), built as a stack of conveying
// strips staircased across the width and clipped to independent front/back splay faces. Each strip is a full belt
// loop: the fabric wraps a rounded 16-segment nose at each end, tangent to the flat top and bottom, with
// white-metal side caps between the strips. Framed by straight L-rails + side guards + a trestle leg. Every
// repeated shape is emitted as instanced templates (MeshPart.instances) sharing the straight belt's pool buckets;
// only the splay-shaped gap-fill prism (+ the strip side caps merged into it) and the two collision guard walls
// stay per-part meshes. The behavior is exactly a straight belt's: step(ctx) drives the surface velocity along the
// flow axis (+X) at the set speed. A negative speed reverses; a PLC run tag gates it. Centred at the origin so the
// host's flat conveying deck (length×width) lines up under the sheared bed.
//
// This is the part's source. `npm run build-parts` writes behavior.ts (this script as the app ships it, with the
// _shared/ modules it imports joined in and `manifest` left out) and rig.json (the manifest).
