// Turntable Conveyor — a rotating redirect table: rotate → align → convey. The deck is a kinematic disc on
// the 'rotate' revolute joint; the hidden `conveys` lane box on top of it is the cargo surface. While slewing,
// the lane's linear velocity is held at 0 and cargo is spun with the platter instead: an arc surface-velocity
// field about the pivot, the same rotational field the deck imparts by friction. Once settled, the lane
// conveys at `speed` along the deck's current forward — the conveys body is static and its surface velocity
// world-space, so the direction is recomputed from the deck angle every tick. By default the deck slews to the
// manual `deckAngleDeg` and holds there — an angled cross-feed you orient from the Inspector, not a
// self-runner. With comms (enableComms) a PLC commands the target angle instead. Its enable tag is the safety
// stop: dropped mid-turn, the deck brakes to a standstill in SAFE_STOP_S still gripping its load, and finishes the
// turn when the tag comes back. A turn not yet begun waits for it.
//
// This is the part's source. `npm run build-parts` writes behavior.ts (this script as the app ships it, with the
// _shared/ modules it imports joined in and `manifest` / `rig()` left out) and rig.json (the manifest, with the

// off 0.7° out one cycle and 4° the next, and on a bare plate it sometimes stopped tracking altogether while
// the deck spun under it. So the deck GRIPS what stands on it for the duration of the turn.
