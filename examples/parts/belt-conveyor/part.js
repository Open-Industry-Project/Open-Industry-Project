// Belt Conveyor — a powered belt conveyor authored as procedural geometry + behavior in one script.
// Demonstrates geometry(g, p): the belt cross-section is lofted along a bent multi-segment path. step(ctx)
// conveys cargo along the flow axis at the configured speed (negative reverses; a PLC run tag start/stops it).
//
// geometry.kind 'drawn': the deck + side-guard cross-section is lofted along the `segments` belt path; the same
// description feeds render + collision, reflowing on a param change (never per tick).
//
// This is the part's source. `npm run build-parts` writes behavior.ts (this script as the app ships it, with the
// _shared/ modules it imports joined in and `manifest` left out) and rig.json (the manifest).
