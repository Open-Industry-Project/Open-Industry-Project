// Pallet Dispenser — a magazine of empty pallets over a conveyor, set down one at a time.
//
// The stack stands between corner guides, held on forks in the BOTTOM pallet's fork pockets. A dispense is the
// machine's own cycle: the carriage sets the stack down on the conveyor, the forks come out, the carriage climbs one
// pallet pitch, the forks go back in (into the second pallet), and the carriage lifts the stack clear — leaving the
// bottom pallet on the conveyor.
//
// Every pallet in the magazine is a REAL pallet, held by the gripper of the magazine position it stands in (p0..p9).
// Nothing is deleted and nothing is made to stand in for it: a pallet a truck loads is the pallet that comes out, with
// its tint, mass and marks. A dispense opens the bottom position's gripper as the forks come out of it; the rest stay
// held, so the stack never stands on its own and the conveyor under it may keep running.
//
// It is COMMANDED: one dispense per request, a request being a rising edge on the dispense tag while a program
// drives it, else a Use, else (Auto dispense) an empty bay. A request that arrives mid-cycle, or while the bay
// still holds the last pallet, waits for it — the machine never sets a stack down on a pallet. Busy reads true
// from the request until the stack is back up, so a controller can hold its conveyor until the pallet is free, and
// the bay eye says whether a pallet is standing ready, so it can keep one waiting.
//
// The enable tag is the safety stop. Dropped mid-cycle, the carriage and forks stop where they are and the stack stays
// held, as it does when the valves drop out. The cycle keeps its place and carries on when the tag comes back. A
// request while it is down is refused. A program wires it to the line running, so a Stop or a trip holds the
// dispense and a Start finishes it.
//
// LOADING: an empty magazine parks its carriage down with the forks out, and a stack of two or more real pallets
// set down in it from the open -Z side and left standing for LOAD_SETTLE seconds is gripped where it stands; the
// forks go into the bottom one and lift the stack to the holding position. More pallets than the magazine has
// positions: the ones above the top position are not held, and stay real cargo standing on the stack.
//
// STOCK is authored: pallets placed at the holding positions (the Inspector's Fill, from the manifest's holds) are
// gripped where they stand when the run starts, so the stopped scene shows what a run starts with. Reload by itself
// when empty is a SOURCE and makes new ones.
//
// This is the part's source. `npm run build-parts` writes behavior.ts (this script as the app ships it, with the
// _shared/ modules it imports joined in and `manifest` / `rig()` left out) and rig.json (the manifest, with the
// rig compiled from rig()).

// The mechanism works the pallet's two SHORT ends (the forks enter along ±X, the conveying direction), so both LONG
// sides are free, and the -Z one is left open: no guide across it and no tie rail at stack height. That is the side
// a fork truck loads from, because a truck can only fork a pallet through its long faces (its blades are too widely
// spaced for the narrow channels the other way).
//
// Geometry is code, not a model: the frame, carriage, forks and cylinders are plain engineered steel, and the fork
// stroke, pallet pitch and conveyor height all have to agree with the behavior.

// 8 decimals, near-zero to 0: the rounding rig.json's derived numbers carry
