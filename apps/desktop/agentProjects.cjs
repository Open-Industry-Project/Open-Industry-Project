// The agent door's project tools (docs/agent-tools.md): list the user's projects, open one, start a new one.
//
// They run here in main, not in the renderer with the other tools, for two reasons. Opening a project reloads the
// editor page, so a page-side tool would never send its answer. And main owns what decides whether a folder may
// open: the folder registry (Open Recent), the folder grants and the native dialog. The editor still does the
// opening, through the same boot path as File > Open (the 'openFolder' and 'newProject' shell requests,
// desktopAgent.ts), so an agent's open is a person's open.
//
// What opens without asking: a folder in Open Recent, or one directly inside the default projects folder. Either the
// user opened it before or the app made it. Any other folder asks the user first. The door is open to every account
// on the machine, and an open project's contents reach the agent, so this keeps another account from reading
// folders through the app. Plain Node - testable with `node apps/desktop/agentProjects.test.cjs`.
