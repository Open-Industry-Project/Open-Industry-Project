// ── What a launch looks like before the app exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────

// the boot skeleton (app/index.html) lands the app's silhouette from static markup at ~600-700ms,
// React commits the real shell over it, and ViewportLoadingCover holds the viewport until the
// building is textured. Nothing here waits for ready-to-show - showing early is safe precisely
// because backgroundColor paints before any document does, so there is no white flash to hide from.
//
// There is no splash window. launch.cmd polls :5173 and only starts Electron once the dev server
// answers, so there is no server wait to cover. A splash can't be sized to line up with this window
// either: window geometry is not settled that early (a window asked for 1536x864 arrives 1487x840, and
// setBounds converges rather than lands - measured). If this window sits blank too long, get the
// document there sooner rather than putting another window in front of it.

// of the page's, so each comes in both. Values = styles.css :root, light-dark(<light>, <dark>).

// `titleBarStyle: 'hidden'` drops the OS bar and `titleBarOverlay` repaints only minimize/maximize/close
// over the app's toolbar, which becomes the drag region (styles.css `.desktop-shell`, which also reserves
// the button strip via env(titlebar-area-*)). The menu bar goes with it - `autoHideMenuBar` keeps Alt as
// the keyboard path and the toolbar's menu button pops the SAME Menu, so there is still one definition.
// Colours have to match `.toolbar`'s --panel/--text or the buttons sit on a patch of the wrong grey.
// macOS is different: the menu belongs to the SCREEN there, not the window, so it keeps the
// system menu bar and only needs the traffic lights floated onto the toolbar - that's `hiddenInset`.
// The strip has TWO right answers, because it outlives the page. Windows paints it the instant the
// window exists - seconds before there is a toolbar under it, and ~700 ms before the renderer paints
// at all (measured) - so a strip fixed to the toolbar's grey spends the whole load as a patch of the
// wrong shade in a corner with nothing around it, which is exactly what it looked like. It starts as
// the colour the FRAME paints instead (backgroundColor, = --bg), leaving an empty window one flat
// shade, and moves to the toolbar's grey when that row becomes the toolbar (preload's 'shell:painted',
// which the boot skeleton satisfies well before React does).
