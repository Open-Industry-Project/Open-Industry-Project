// Self-hosted Hocuspocus (Yjs) backend for oip-web live collaborative editing.
//
// One Yjs document per room (one shared project: its scene, program and parts), keyed by the
// document name the client passes.
// SQLite gives durable persistence so a room survives restarts and a late joiner gets
// the current state.
//
// Access model (no accounts - see src/collab/rooms.ts for the client half):
//   - Every room: doc name `r-<sha256(secret)>`, edit secret `e-<uuid>`. onAuthenticate
//     grants write access only when sha256(token) matches the doc name; every other connection
//     is read-only at the protocol level (view links carry no secret).
//   - Any other doc name is refused in onConnect, before a room can be created. That includes
//     a name that would be both the room id and the credential. Rows the db holds under such
//     names are unreachable, and the idle GC removes them in time.
//
// Hardening (all limits overridable via env, see the constants below):
//   - binds to loopback (HOST) by default: Caddy on the same box is the only way in, which is
//     also what makes its X-Forwarded-For trustworthy
//   - per-IP live-connection cap and new-room creation throttle (onConnect); an IPv6 client
//     counts by its /64, the block one subscriber is handed
//   - per-message and per-document size caps (ws maxPayload + beforeHandleMessage), and a
//     separate, much smaller cap on awareness (presence) messages
//   - stateless messages refused: the app never sends one, and BroadcastStateless would let any
//     viewer relay arbitrary text to every connection in a room
//   - idle-room GC: rooms untouched for ROOM_TTL_DAYS are deleted (daily sweep)
//   - periodic snapshots of each active room into a `snapshots` table (restore = one
//     UPDATE, see server/DEPLOY.md); a room whose bytes equal its newest snapshot is skipped
//   - GET /healthz for uptime monitoring
//   - /assets/<sha256>: the bytes of parts' embedded models, so a room's document carries only their hashes
//     (assets.mjs: public GET by hash, PUT only with a room edit secret, capped per file and per IP per hour, and
//     swept daily once no stored room or snapshot names them)
//
// Deploy notes: expose over wss:// (Caddy) and point the frontend at it via
// VITE_COLLAB_URL. See docs/collab.md + server/DEPLOY.md.
